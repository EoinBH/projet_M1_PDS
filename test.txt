Long Running Bands With the Exact Same Lineup?. The longest one I know of is Keith Jarrett’s “Standard” trio with Jack DeJohnette (Rip) and Gary Peacock, 1983 - 2014. 31 years. What a run they had!  The only other band I can think of off the top of my head that spanned over three decades is kind of a cheat:  Joshua Redman’s Moodswing band from 1994, reunited in 2020 & 2022.  What are some other long running bands?  And, why don’t bands stay together long?Looking for more minimalist jazz!. I've really been enjoying this recent sound in jazz inspired by minimalist composers such as Steve Reich and Terry Riley. I love the long, evolving jams built from simple riffs that expand into bliss. If anyone has some recommendations along these lines it would be greatly appreciated!!Jazz “with strings”. Any recommendations old or new, in or out!. Off the top of my head. Charlie Parker, Clifford Brown, Lee Konitz, Paul Desmond, Chet Baker, Stan Getz.. any other recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Voodoo impact on jazz musicians. So... with D'angelos passing i saw a lot of comments from people who were in college in 2000 and early 2000s talking about the influence of Voodoo in the jazz community. Were you there? How was it like? The discussions were centered about that Dilla rhythm aspect or in other things like timbre, tone, arrangements? Also trying to know some jazz records inspired by this album.

Understanding why Duke Ellington's earlier work is considered his best. I love Duke Ellington, and my favorite album of his is Masterpieces. In my opinion the compositions and arrangements are second to none, with Solitude and the Tattooed Bride making me tear up nearly every time I hear them (side note, I feel like the trumpet solo on that Solitude recording deserves so much more recognition, it's so simple but so heart-wrenching). In general, I gravitate towards his somewhat later stuff, I also love Live at Newport, Far East Suite, His Mother Called Him Bill, and many others. However, I have noticed a strong majority of Ellington fans seem to think his best work was with the Blanton-Webster band. While I'm not disputing the fact that those recordings are wonderful and has probably his "best" lineup, to my ears his composition and arrangement skill only increased over time, and I'm having a hard time seeing why people prefer that his work from that period to, say, Masterpieces for example. Is this maybe a historical sort of thing, a matter of taste, or is there something else I'm missing? Thanks!Someone from the Wireguard development team apparently likes Jazz Guitar.

Kinda wish this song got popular and not It’s Been A Long, Long Time (as good as that one is).Keith Jarrett Trio - All of You .Jack Dejohnette the incredible drummer putting in work with the trio. RIP Jazz Master. Help me find a song?. Ok - I realize this isn't necessarily Jazz, but this is probably the closest subreddit with a significant number of members, and there's enough crossover that I hope you can help.  I'm traveling, and the internet is pretty weak - so using YouTube, Spotify, etc, is a no-go.  I'm looking for an old crooner/Great American Songbook piece...the ending is stuck in my head - except the last and crucial word, and I'm losing my mind over it.  Anyway - this is a slow piece, which I remember feeling a bit nostalgic/wistful.  I feel like I hear Frank singing it, but honestly, it could be anyone.  The song winds down with a ritardando into the phrase "In old <city>."  I can't for the life of me remember the city, which is the key to unlocking the whole thing.  I'm simultaneously hearing San Juan, Algiers, and Bombay - any of which *could* be right, but all of which are probably wrong.  Any ideas?   EDIT:  As I was falling asleep, it finally hit me.  Thanks all, for the suggestions, but the song is "In Old Cape Code," originally by Patti Page but covered by just about everyone.Music History Events:Albums released October 28:Best Sheet Music download from our Library.Please, subscribe to our Library.Browse in the Library:Ben HarperSearch your favorite sheet music in the Sheet Music Catalog Music History Events: Albums released October 28: 1966 - THE KINKS - ‘Face to.

We've been practicing our style of spiritual jazz fusion for a few months now and this is the first track we've released!! Excited to get hopefully some positive feedback!! :-). We make a blend of spiritual jazz fusion mixed with elements of hip hop, IDM, soul, hard funk, and progressive rock. Our influences include Miles Davis, Parliament Funkadelic, Chuck Mangione, Motown/Stax, Pink Floyd, Elton John, Bill or Gil Evans, Weather Report, Iron Maiden, Drexciya, and much hip hop. We're currently accepting upcoming show offers for ..November.. and ..December.. in Connecticut/NYC area and beyond so if you're interested, feel free to contact us through our inbox here!! :-) Why do I think 90s jazz sucks?. I may be in the minority here but there's something about a ton of jazz from the 80s and 90s that I just can't stand and I can't really put my finger on it. It could be the glossy production, although hi-fi from the 60s and 70s sounds great. I can't fault the musical integrity of it, a lot of it is made by artists who had been making amazing stuff for decades at that point. Is it the synths? The soundstage? The influence of fusion? Even the throwback, cooler and bluesier stuff always sticks out to me as a bit cloying and busy, and even though I'm now firmly one of them, it still evokes childhood memories of sad middle aged white men who ramble about influences and modes, wearing linen and bragging about wines they've sampled and places they've traveled.  Does anyone else feel this way? Was there a movement in jazz culture or the production that dictated this, or is it just like film where something from a certain time just feels a certain way and it's too intangible to ascribe to anything except the march of human progress?  Edited to add: In case it doesn't go without saying, I'd love to hear some great 90s recs if you have some! Doesn't have to be non-90s sounding, I really should be open to changing my mind on this.Makaya McCraven in Seattle last night.

Some of the craziest drums recorded in all of jazz, and just in 1970! Rip to one of the greatest to ever do it!Is Wayne Bergeron a jazz musician?. For context: I made a post ranking my favorite jazz trumpeters and included Bergeron as an honorable mention. Someone commented that he’s not known as a jazz musician, to which I pushed back a little and said (in a comment that isn’t shown here) that almost everything he’s known for and most of the awards he’s gotten have been for jazz projects. His albums are all jazz.   I really have no stake in this argument but it seems to be really important to this guy so what do you folks think?We Lost Anthony Jackson and Jack DeJohnette in the last few weeks. Does anyone know of any recordings of them playing together?. I'm not particularly familiar with either of their music, except for some albums with Jack on drums.

Jazz Art Project From 20 Years Ago. Was cleaning an old closet and found the 3 remaining jazz musicians I kept from an art project I did in college. I had around 30 of these made for some of my favorite jazz musicians. Just felt like sharing!I liked some Jazz, I disliked some other. Where should I start exploring?. Hi,  As someone who never really listened to Jazz, I never understood the vibe surrounding it ("jazz is more than music, jazz is life" kind of statements). Anyhow, I don't want to reject something I never tried to understand, so I want to give Jazz a shot.  I also don't really understand what Jazz is, or how the subgenres are structured.  For example: I started listening to "kind of blue" by Miles Davis, but I didn't really enjoy it. To me it was Music, but nothing more, and nothing I would actively listend to. Maybe for an elevator, or when hanging out with friends, but in this case, I would prefer lofi hip-hop (maybe even with jazz influence, but not undiluted).  On the other hand, I once read a blog post on where the author claimed jazz people are pretentious, and as a prime example the author used Om by john Coltrane. I gave it a listen and my thoughts were: wow this is bullshit and I love it!  I was laughing through the whole track and not because I was making fun of it, but because I felt something I can't really explain. If I were to confirm the authors prejudice I would say something like "jazz is the dadaism of music. It breaks the convention and experiments with what is allowed in music", but I would prefer to put it like this: this track is musical shitposting (not in a bad way).  I felt the same when first listening to 100gecs. There is a shock value, but it's not the whole thing, there is still something else.  I want to continue exploring Jazz, so I was wondering if someone has any recommendations based on those experiences. It doesn't need to be absolute nonsense like Om, but in general I think I prefer faster music (Punk, Hyperpop, ...), and I prefer experimental over classic.  TLDR: I liked Om by John Coltrane, but I found nothing interesting in "kind of blue" by Miles Davis. Is there something you would recommend?Billy Cobham tonight in Manchester. The man himself.

Also this was me in a past life and no I will not be hearing any other opinions.Besame Mucho — between two voices (live, with my original Russian lyrics). Some songs don’t age — they transform with you.  For me, \*Besame Mucho\* has always been one of them.  I’ve approached it in many ways — through electronics, through jazz, through a Latin pulse.  But the live version became something else.  It’s sung with my own Russian lyrics — a dialogue between piano and voice,  where Latin warmth meets Russian introspection.  Nothing rehearsed, nothing repeated.  Just a moment that happened — raw, expressive, fragile in the best way.  Among other jazz interpretations, my favorite has always been \*\*Michel Petrucciani’s version\*\* —    so different in spirit, yet sharing that sense of freedom and lyrical depth.    I often think of this one as the culmination of my vocal path with the song.  The purely piano story is still ahead, waiting for its turn to breathe.  — G.G.  🎧 \[Listen on Spotify\](your\_spotify\_link)  [https://open.spotify.com/track/7ltqSgIzSce6TKCZpJFJYE](https://open.spotify.com/track/7ltqSgIzSce6TKCZpJFJYE)  🎥 \[Watch the live video\](your\_youtube\_link) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj1MjtymwKI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj1MjtymwKI)Guide tones vs aural translation in practice. Hellooo internet,  I am a guitarist who has been learning jazz for the past 6-ish months. I have a question about approaching chord changes via guide tones.  I have been told, EVERYWHERE, that guide tones are absolutely essential to improvising. I understand that guide tones are essential for defining the colour and function of a chord, and bringing them out in your solo will make everything more cohesive.   However, I've found that practicing audiation whilst improvising far more invaluable. If I think of a melody in my head, then having the ability to play it seems to naturally gravitate towards those tones anyway (though, not intentionally.)  What is the justification for exhaustively practicing approaching guide tones be over simply learning to aurally translate to your instrument?

I really can't decide which piano solo I like more, but I know I like them more than just about anything.  Is it the lyrical chords of Wynton Kelly, or the rolling arpeggios of McCoy Tyner?

A Fun Billie Holiday Song: “I’m Gonna Lock My Heart (And Throw Away The Key)” by Billie Holiday (1938). I know that sounds like an oxymoron, Billie Holiday and lighthearted fun, but even Lady Day had some lighthearted (dare I say frivolous) and fun songs in her catalogue that aren’t as well known as her powerful blues and ballads.  This one is my personal favorite example of this. It was also one of Billie’s most popular songs of the 1930s, peaking at #2 on the pop charts. To think, a song like this was recorded only a year before Strange Fruit.r/jazzfusion said it was actually free jazz .... Gimme some good beginner jazz albums plsss.

I'm trying to create a jazz improv video game and am wondering if anyone knows anything about algorithms or functions that can compare two short melodic phrases and see how similar they are (repetition: completely similar; an ascending/descending sequence: moderately similar; small rhythmic variations: moderately similar; completely unrelated: not similar). Ideally it would also be able to compare a melody to its inversion as somewhat similar.  This is something we can more or less do speedily/subconsciously as music listeners or jazz listeners, but I'm wondering how do you turn it into something that an app might be able to understand.What’s the jazz version of “anyway here’s Wonderwall.”.

It's a slower toon, I first heard it at a spring jazz concert and I think the word "spring" was in the title but I don't remember. Heavily features the saxophone, the sound is sometimes in tik Tok.   I know I provided no useful info but Ive looked up 50 different songs and none of them were it.   Edit: I'm starting to think the word "spring" is not in the title John Scofield AND Dave Holland!!. I can't wait for this one! So excited. Two masters!An example of Walking Bassline Burner style of solo piano.

(is spotify search broken on web for anyone else?  also, he has weird, blindingly white teeth!)  edit: [toytoy](https://www.toytoymusic.com/)High tempo jazz is amazing. Would recommend listening to it Chet Baker’s my funny valentine. My second jazz cover ever, would appreciate your honest opinion guys! Album Recommendations. I thought I would go through my playlist and share some lesser known jazz albums that I like. Hope you enjoy!Need recommendations on slow jazz fusion tracks. I really like these types of "slow burner" jazz fusion tracks, songs like Herbie Hancock's 'Vein Melter' or Kool & The Gang's 'Summer Madness', so chill and easy going, i wonder if there is a especific genre/albums/artists focused on that, and would love if y'all had some names to share.HL2DM â (Fushionhead Jazz Club) Itâs Low Gravity!. Chicago is a jazz city, but where are the jazz radio stations? - WBEZ Chicago. "Today, WDCB, a radio station at the College of DuPage in west suburban Glen Ellyn, is the only known all-jazz station in the region. It’s the third largest jazz station in the country. There are also still well-loved shows, such as those at the University of Chicago’s WHPK that Beland enjoys, but catching those depends on the time of the day.  So why doesn’t Chicago, a city where you can catch a jazz performance almost any night of the week, have more radio stations where you can hear the same? The answer is the radio industry has changed, and Chicago has not been an exception to this evolution."  https://www.wbez.org/curious-city/2025/10/22/chicago-is-a-jazz-city-but-where-are-the-jazz-radio-stationsIf you could go back in time and be in the audience at a live Jazz show that made it onto a record (or video), whether you just missed it or it was before you were born, what would it be?. I was just remembering being a kid in the 80s, maybe 14 years old, listening to Dave Brubeck at Carnegie Hall and wishing I could go back to 1963 to hear it live. It was a moment in my journey as I was learning how to listen to Jazz music. So, it occurred to me to ask this question as an adult who became a Jazz drummer!  I’ll go first. It’s impossible to choose just one, so I’ll do a few…  Number one: the Coltrane quartet live in Comblain-la-tour Belgium, 1965. This is a filmed concert (can’t tell if it was originally shot on video or film?) and it’s the best thing I’ve ever heard. To me, it’s the highest height you can reach playing this kinda music.   Number two would be the Miles show at Lincoln Center in 1964 that the albums My Funny Valentine and Four & More came from. Hearing this material blew my mind and was key to my journey.   Hmmm what’s 3? Maybe Coltrane live at Birdland, on whatever night “I Want to Talk About You” was recorded.   Then, the December 22, 1965 set of Miles at the Plugged Nickel, which is on disc 2a of the complete Plugged Nickel box set. Wayne Shorter blows my mind on Four and When I Fall in Love.   The Keith Jarrett Trio from the album Standards Live, which was a concert in 1985.   Sonny Rollins, the show that came out on CD as “The Montreal Concert, 1982.” My brother was actually at that show with my Mom, so I coulda gone! I love this set, and Jack DeJohnette is there, one of my heroes.   I could go on for a while haha, but what about you all?Whats a band like bohren and der club of gore but with guitar. lot of guitar pleasewant more albums like Ahmad Jamal Trio's Awakening. I like the simplicity and mood of that album and how the piano is basically the star of the show for the entire album.  McCoy Tyner Quartet. McCoy Tyner, p; Joe Lovano, ts; Christian McBride, b; Jeff "Tain" Watts, d. Recorded live at Yoshi's, Oakland. December 30-31, 2006. Released 2007How Bill Evans learnt to play Piano and his shift to Jazz. Bill Evans learned to play through a combination of classical training from a young age and dedicated self-study of jazz, which included transcribing and improvising based on the music of other artists. He developed his skills through an intense work ethic, practicing constantly, and focusing on the underlying harmony of music.   His shift to Jazz Although proficient in classical music, Evans was unable to play a simple tune without the written notes. A turning point came around age 13 when he was exposed to jazz through big bands like those of Tommy Dorsey and Harry James. While playing a stock arrangement of "Tuxedo Junction" with a local band, he impulsively added an unwritten musical phrase. The thrill of creating something original and unwritten sparked his passion for improvisation.  Best introduction to jazz saxophone albums. Fairly new to enjoying jazz music and I really want to educate myself on the best saxophone albums to listen to. Currently loving anything smooth - that feeling of being in a dark smoky club vibe. Thanks Spooky, moody jazz recommendations?. Idk if this will make sense, and I'm new to jazz.  Im looking for some stuff to add to my vinyl collection and I love the New Orleans jazz/blues that has that dark, moody, spooky, voodoo vibe. Like Halloween in New Orleans vibes.  Any recommendations? A jazz beat I made. For the classical fans. A very cool arrangement of Prokofiev's 3rd Piano Concerto. Played by the famous NZ concert pianist Michael Houston and the Rodger Fox Big Band, a very prolific band in NZ and internationally, who have played with the likes of Michael Brecker. I highly recommend it, even if you're not a fan of classical music.

I literally love "La Vie en Rose" from Louis Armstrong, although is from a completely different era than mine, I have to admit I kinda fell in love immediately with this song. Stan Getz & Bob Brookmeyer - We'll Be Together Again. This 50's live concert is one the great overlooked concerts in jazz history. This L.A. concert features tenor sax legend Stan Get with the equally legendary valve trombonist, Bob Brookmeyer. An interesting aspect of this concert is how old fashioned the music sounds but still maintains an air of passion and sophistication. A perfect example of this is the well known standard We'll Be Together Again. This is my second favorite version of this tune and I hope it will be a favorite of yours as well.

Jazz pianists often uniquely interpret jazz standards. Passages from these interpretations can be viewed as sections of variation. We manually extracted such variations from solo jazz piano performances. The JAZZVAR dataset is a collection of 502 pairs of Variation and Original MIDI segments. Each Variation in the dataset is accompanied by a corresponding Original segment containing the melody and chords from the original jazz standard. Our approach differs from many existing jazz datasets in the music information retrieval (MIR) community, which often focus on improvisation sections within jazz performances. In this paper, we outline the curation process for obtaining and sorting the repertoire, the pipeline for creating the Original and Variation pairs, and our analysis of the dataset. We also introduce a new generative music task, Music Overpainting, and present a baseline Transformer model trained on the JAZZVAR dataset for this task. Other potential applications of our dataset include expressive performance analysis and performer identification.FiloBass: A Dataset and Corpus Based Study of Jazz Basslines. We present FiloBass: a novel corpus of music scores and annotations which focuses on the important but often overlooked role of the double bass in jazz accompaniment. Inspired by recent work that sheds light on the role of the soloist, we offer a collection of 48 manually verified transcriptions of professional jazz bassists, comprising over 50,000 note events, which are based on the backing tracks used in the FiloSax dataset. For each recording we provide audio stems, scores, performance-aligned MIDI and associated metadata for beats, downbeats, chord symbols and markers for musical form.   We then use FiloBass to enrich our understanding of jazz bass lines, by conducting a corpus-based musical analysis with a contrastive study of existing instructional methods. Together with the original FiloSax dataset, our work represents a significant step toward a fully annotated performance dataset for a jazz quartet setting. By illuminating the critical role of the bass in jazz, this work contributes to a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the genre.Improving Automatic Jazz Melody Generation by Transfer Learning   Techniques. In this paper, we tackle the problem of transfer learning for Jazz automatic generation. Jazz is one of representative types of music, but the lack of Jazz data in the MIDI format hinders the construction of a generative model for Jazz. Transfer learning is an approach aiming to solve the problem of data insufficiency, so as to transfer the common feature from one domain to another. In view of its success in other machine learning problems, we investigate whether, and how much, it can help improve automatic music generation for under-resourced musical genres. Specifically, we use a recurrent variational autoencoder as the generative model, and use a genre-unspecified dataset as the source dataset and a Jazz-only dataset as the target dataset. Two transfer learning methods are evaluated using six levels of source-to-target data ratios. The first method is to train the model on the source dataset, and then fine-tune the resulting model parameters on the target dataset. The second method is to train the model on both the source and target datasets at the same time, but add genre labels to the latent vectors and use a genre classifier to improve Jazz generation. The evaluation results show that the second method seems to perform better overall, but it cannot take full advantage of the genre-unspecified dataset.Comparative Assessment of Markov Models and Recurrent Neural Networks   for Jazz Music Generation. As generative models have risen in popularity, a domain that has risen alongside is generative models for music. Our study aims to compare the performance of a simple Markov chain model and a recurrent neural network (RNN) model, two popular models for sequence generating tasks, in jazz music improvisation. While music, especially jazz, remains subjective in telling whether a composition is "good" or "bad", we aim to quantify our results using metrics of groove pattern similarity and pitch class histogram entropy. We trained both models using transcriptions of jazz blues choruses from professional jazz players, and also fed musical jazz seeds to help give our model some context in beginning the generation. Our results show that the RNN outperforms the Markov model on both of our metrics, indicating better rhythmic consistency and tonal stability in the generated music. Through the use of music21 library, we tokenized our jazz dataset into pitches and durations that our model could interpret and train on. Our findings contribute to the growing field of AI-generated music, highlighting the important use of metrics to assess generation quality. Future work includes expanding the dataset of MIDI files to a larger scale, conducting human surveys for subjective evaluations, and incorporating additional metrics to address the challenge of subjectivity in music evaluation. Our study provides valuable insight into the use of recurrent neural networks for sequential based tasks like generating music.Correlated microtiming deviations in jazz and rock music. Musical rhythms performed by humans typically show temporal fluctuations. While they have been characterized in simple rhythmic tasks, it is an open question what is the nature of temporal fluctuations, when several musicians perform music jointly in all its natural complexity. To study such fluctuations in over 100 original jazz and rock/pop recordings played with and without metronome we developed a semi-automated workflow allowing the extraction of cymbal beat onsets with millisecond precision. Analyzing the inter-beat interval (IBI) time series revealed evidence for two long-range correlated processes characterized by power laws in the IBI power spectral densities. One process dominates on short timescales ($t < 8$ beats) and reflects microtiming variability in the generation of single beats. The other dominates on longer timescales and reflects slow tempo variations. Whereas the latter did not show differences between musical genres (jazz vs. rock/pop), the process on short timescales showed higher variability for jazz recordings, indicating that jazz makes stronger use of microtiming fluctuations within a measure than rock/pop. Our results elucidate principles of rhythmic performance and can inspire algorithms for artificial music generation. By studying microtiming fluctuations in original music recordings, we bridge the gap between minimalistic tapping paradigms and expressive rhythmic performances.The Jazz Transformer on the Front Line: Exploring the Shortcomings of   AI-composed Music through Quantitative Measures. This paper presents the Jazz Transformer, a generative model that utilizes a neural sequence model called the Transformer-XL for modeling lead sheets of Jazz music. Moreover, the model endeavors to incorporate structural events present in the Weimar Jazz Database (WJazzD) for inducing structures in the generated music. While we are able to reduce the training loss to a low value, our listening test suggests however a clear gap between the average ratings of the generated and real compositions. We therefore go one step further and conduct a series of computational analysis of the generated compositions from different perspectives. This includes analyzing the statistics of the pitch class, grooving, and chord progression, assessing the structureness of the music with the help of the fitness scape plot, and evaluating the model's understanding of Jazz music through a MIREX-like continuation prediction task. Our work presents in an analytical manner why machine-generated music to date still falls short of the artwork of humanity, and sets some goals for future work on automatic composition to further pursue.Modulation in Tetradic Harmony and its Role in Jazz. After a quick exposition of Mazzola's quantum modulation model for the so-called triadic interpretation of the major scale within the equal temperament, we study the model for the tetradic interpretation of the same scale. It is known that tetrads are fundamental for jazz music, and some classical objects for this kind of music are recovered.Community Structure in Jazz. Using a database of jazz recordings we study the collaboration network of jazz musicians. We define the network at two different levels. First we study the collaboration network between individuals, where two musicians are connected if they have played in the same band. Then we consider the collaboration between bands, where two bands are connected if they have a musician in common. The community structure analysis reveals that these constructions capture essential ingredients of the social interactions between jazz musicians. We observe correlations between recording locations, racial segregation and the community structure. A quantitative analysis of the community size distribution reveals a surprising similarity with an e-mail based social network recently studied.Optical Music Recognition of Jazz Lead Sheets. In this paper, we address the challenge of Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for handwritten jazz lead sheets, a widely used musical score type that encodes melody and chords. The task is challenging due to the presence of chords, a score component not handled by existing OMR systems, and the high variability and quality issues associated with handwritten images. Our contribution is two-fold. We present a novel dataset consisting of 293 handwritten jazz lead sheets of 163 unique pieces, amounting to 2021 total staves aligned with Humdrum **kern and MusicXML ground truth scores. We also supply synthetic score images generated from the ground truth. The second contribution is the development of an OMR model for jazz lead sheets. We discuss specific tokenisation choices related to our kind of data, and the advantages of using synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and models.Reinforcement Learning Jazz Improvisation: When Music Meets Game Theory. Live performances of music are always charming, with the unpredictability of improvisation due to the dynamic between musicians and interactions with the audience. Jazz improvisation is a particularly noteworthy example for further investigation from a theoretical perspective. Here, we introduce a novel mathematical game theory model for jazz improvisation, providing a framework for studying music theory and improvisational methodologies. We use computational modeling, mainly reinforcement learning, to explore diverse stochastic improvisational strategies and their paired performance on improvisation. We find that the most effective strategy pair is a strategy that reacts to the most recent payoff (Stepwise Changes) with a reinforcement learning strategy limited to notes in the given chord (Chord-Following Reinforcement Learning). Conversely, a strategy that reacts to the partner's last note and attempts to harmonize with it (Harmony Prediction) strategy pair yields the lowest non-control payoff and highest standard deviation, indicating that picking notes based on immediate reactions to the partner player can yield inconsistent outcomes. On average, the Chord-Following Reinforcement Learning strategy demonstrates the highest mean payoff, while Harmony Prediction exhibits the lowest. Our work lays the foundation for promising applications beyond jazz: including the use of artificial intelligence (AI) models to extract data from audio clips to refine musical reward systems, and training machine learning (ML) models on existing jazz solos to further refine strategies within the game.A Comparison of Random Forests and Ferns on Recognition of Instruments   in Jazz Recordings. In this paper, we first apply random ferns for classification of real music recordings of a jazz band. No initial segmentation of audio data is assumed, i.e., no onset, offset, nor pitch data are needed. The notion of random ferns is described in the paper, to familiarize the reader with this classification algorithm, which was introduced quite recently and applied so far in image recognition tasks. The performance of random ferns is compared with random forests for the same data. The results of experiments are presented in the paper, and conclusions are drawn.Mining Software Metrics from Jazz. In this paper, we describe the extraction of source code metrics from the Jazz repository and the application of data mining techniques to identify the most useful of those metrics for predicting the success or failure of an attempt to construct a working instance of the software product. We present results from a systematic study using the J48 classification method. The results indicate that only a relatively small number of the available software metrics that we considered have any significance for predicting the outcome of a build. These significant metrics are discussed and implication of the results discussed, particularly the relative difficulty of being able to predict failed build attempts.Decision-Based Transcription of Jazz Guitar Solos Using a Harmonic   Bident Analysis Filter Bank and Spectral Distribution Weighting. Jazz guitar solos are improvised melody lines played on one instrument on top of a chordal accompaniment (comping). As the improvisation happens spontaneously, a reference score is non-existent, only a lead sheet. There are situations, however, when one would like to have the original melody lines in the form of notated music, see the Real Book. The motivation is either for the purpose of practice and imitation or for musical analysis. In this work, an automatic transcriber for jazz guitar solos is developed. It resorts to a very intuitive representation of tonal music signals: the pitchgram. No instrument-specific modeling is involved, so the transcriber should be applicable to other pitched instruments as well. Neither is there the need to learn any note profiles prior to or during the transcription. Essentially, the proposed transcriber is a decision tree, thus a classifier, with a depth of 3. It has a (very) low computational complexity and can be run on-line. The decision rules can be refined or extended with no or little musical education. The transcriber's performance is evaluated on a set of ten jazz solo excerpts and compared with a state-of-the-art transcription system for the guitar plus PYIN. We achieve an improvement of 34% w.r.t. the reference system and 19% w.r.t. PYIN in terms of the F-measure. Another measure of accuracy, the error score, attests that the number of erroneous pitch detections is reduced by more than 50% w.r.t. the reference system and by 45% w.r.t. PYIN.Does it Swing? Microtiming Deviations and Swing Feeling in Jazz. Jazz music that swings has the fascinating power to elicit a pleasant sensation of flow in listeners and the desire to synchronize body movements with the music. Whether microtiming deviations (MTDs), i.e. small timing deviations below the bar or phrase level, enhance the feeling of swing is highly debated in the current literature. Studies on other groove related genres did not find evidence for a positive impact of MTDs. The present study addresses jazz music and swing in particular, as there is some evidence that microtiming patterns are genre-specific. We recorded twelve piano jazz standards played by a professional pianist and manipulated the natural MTDs of the recordings in systematic ways by quantizing, expanding and inverting them. MTDs were defined with respect to a grid determined by the average swing ratio. The original and manipulated versions were presented in an online survey and evaluated by 160 listeners with various musical skill levels and backgrounds. Across pieces the quantized versions (without MTDs) were rated slightly higher and versions with expanded MTDs were rated lower with regard to swing than the original recordings. Unexpectedly, inversion had no impact on swing ratings except for two pieces. Our results suggest that naturally fluctuating MTDs are not an essential factor for the feeling of swing.What can developers' messages tell us? A psycholinguistic analysis of   Jazz teams' attitudes and behavior patterns. Reports that communication and behavioral issues contribute to inadequately performing software teams have fuelled a wealth of research aimed at understanding the human processes employed during software development. The increasing level of interest in human issues is particularly relevant for agile and global software development approaches that emphasize the importance of people and their interactions during projects. While mature analysis techniques in behavioral psychology have been recommended for studying such issues, particularly when using archives and artifacts, these techniques have rarely been used in software engineering research. We utilize these techniques under an embedded case study approach to examine whether IBM Rational Jazz practitioners' behaviors change over project duration and whether certain tasks affect teams' attitudes and behaviors. We found highest levels of project engagement at project start and completion, as well as increasing levels of team collectiveness as projects progressed. Additionally, Jazz practitioners were most insightful and perceptive at the time of project scoping. Further, Jazz teams' attitudes and behaviors varied in line with the nature of the tasks they were performing. We explain these findings and discuss their implications for software project governance and tool design.Differences in Jazz Project Leaders' Competencies and Behaviors: A   Preliminary Empirical Investigation. Studying the human factors that impact on software development, and assigning individuals with specific competencies and qualities to particular software roles, have been shown to aid software project performance. For instance, prior evidence suggests that extroverted software project leaders are most successful. Role assignment based on individuals' competencies and behaviors may be especially relevant in distributed software development contexts where teams are often affected by distance, cultural, and personality issues. Project leaders in these environments need to possess high levels of inter-personal, intra-personal and organizational competencies if they are to appropriately manage such issues and maintain positive project performance. With a view to understanding and explaining the specific competencies and behaviors that are required of project leaders in these settings, we used psycholinguistic and directed content analysis to study the way six successful IBM Rational Jazz leaders operated while coordinating their three distributed projects. Contrary to previous evidence reported in personality studies, our results did not reveal universal competencies and behaviors among these Jazz leaders. Instead, Jazz project leaders' competencies and behaviors varied with their project portfolio of tasks. Our findings suggest that a pragmatic approach that considers the nature of the software tasks being developed is likely to be a more effective strategy for assigning leaders to distributed software teams, as against a strategy that promotes a specific personality type. We discuss these findings and outline implications for distributed software project governance.Forbidden triads and Creative Success in Jazz: The Miles Davis Factor. This article argues for the importance of forbidden triads - open triads with high-weight edges - in predicting success in creative fields. Forbidden triads had been treated as a residual category beyond closed and open triads, yet I argue that these structures provide opportunities to combine socially evolved styles in new ways. Using data on the entire history of recorded jazz from 1896 to 2010, I show that observed collaborations have tolerated the openness of high weight triads more than expected, observed jazz sessions had more forbidden triads than expected, and the density of forbidden triads contributed to the success of recording sessions, measured by the number of record releases of session material. The article also shows that the sessions of Miles Davis had received an especially high boost from forbidden triads.Exploring Transformer-Based Music Overpainting for Jazz Piano Variations. This paper explores transformer-based models for music overpainting, focusing on jazz piano variations. Music overpainting generates new variations while preserving the melodic and harmonic structure of the input. Existing approaches are limited by small datasets, restricting scalability and diversity. We introduce VAR4000, a subset of a larger dataset for jazz piano performances, consisting of 4,352 training pairs. Using a semi-automatic pipeline, we evaluate two transformer configurations on VAR4000, comparing their performance with the smaller JAZZVAR dataset. Preliminary results show promising improvements in generalisation and performance with the larger dataset configuration, highlighting the potential of transformer models to scale effectively for music overpainting on larger and more diverse datasets.Tune It Up: Music Genre Transfer and Prediction. Deep generative models have been used in style transfer tasks for images. In this study, we adapt and improve CycleGAN model to perform music style transfer on Jazz and Classic genres. By doing so, we aim to easily generate new songs, cover music to different music genres and reduce the arrangements needed in those processes. We train and use music genre classifier to assess the performance of the transfer models. To that end, we obtain 87.7% accuracy with Multi-layer Perceptron algorithm. To improve our style transfer baseline, we add auxiliary discriminators and triplet loss to our model. According to our experiments, we obtain the best accuracies as 69.4% in Jazz to Classic task and 39.3% in Classic to Jazz task with our developed genre classifier. We also run a subjective experiment and results of it show that the overall performance of our transfer model is good and it manages to conserve melody of inputs on the transferred outputs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ fidansamet/tune-it-upLisp, Jazz, Aikido -- Three Expressions of a Single Essence. The relation between Science (what we can explain) and Art (what we can't) has long been acknowledged and while every science contains an artistic part, every art form also needs a bit of science. Among all scientific disciplines, programming holds a special place for two reasons. First, the artistic part is not only undeniable but also essential. Second, and much like in a purely artistic discipline, the act of programming is driven partly by the notion of aesthetics: the pleasure we have in creating beautiful things. Even though the importance of aesthetics in the act of programming is now unquestioned, more could still be written on the subject. The field called "psychology of programming" focuses on the cognitive aspects of the activity, with the goal of improving the productivity of programmers. While many scientists have emphasized their concern for aesthetics and the impact it has on their activity, few computer scientists have actually written about their thought process while programming. What makes us like or dislike such and such language or paradigm? Why do we shape our programs the way we do? By answering these questions from the angle of aesthetics, we may be able to shed some new light on the art of programming. Starting from the assumption that aesthetics is an inherently transversal dimension, it should be possible for every programmer to find the same aesthetic driving force in every creative activity they undertake, not just programming, and in doing so, get deeper insight on why and how they do things the way they do. On the other hand, because our aesthetic sensitivities are so personal, all we can really do is relate our own experiences and share it with others, in the hope that it will inspire them to do the same. My personal life has been revolving around three major creative activities, of equal importance: programming in Lisp, playing Jazz music, and practicing Aikido. But why so many of them, why so different ones, and why these specifically? By introspecting my personal aesthetic sensitivities, I eventually realized that my tastes in the scientific, artistic, and physical domains are all motivated by the same driving forces, hence unifying Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido as three expressions of a single essence, not so different after all. Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido are governed by a limited set of rules which remain simple and unobtrusive. Conforming to them is a pleasure. Because Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido are inherently introspective disciplines, they also invite you to transgress the rules in order to find your own. Breaking the rules is fun. Finally, if Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido unify so many paradigms, styles, or techniques, it is not by mere accumulation but because they live at the meta-level and let you reinvent them. Working at the meta-level is an enlightening experience. Understand your aesthetic sensitivities and you may gain considerable insight on your own psychology of programming. Mine is perhaps common to most lispers. Perhaps also common to other programming communities, but that, is for the reader to decide...Reconstructing the Charlie Parker Omnibook using an audio-to-score   automatic transcription pipeline. The Charlie Parker Omnibook is a cornerstone of jazz music education, described by pianist Ethan Iverson as "the most important jazz education text ever published". In this work we propose a new transcription pipeline and explore the extent to which state of the art music technology is able to reconstruct these scores directly from the audio without human intervention. Our pipeline includes: a newly trained source separation model for saxophone, a new MIDI transcription model for solo saxophone and an adaptation of an existing MIDI-to-score method for monophonic instruments.   To assess this pipeline we also provide an enhanced dataset of Charlie Parker transcriptions as score-audio pairs with accurate MIDI alignments and downbeat annotations. This represents a challenging new benchmark for automatic audio-to-score transcription that we hope will advance research into areas beyond transcribing audio-to-MIDI alone.   Together, these form another step towards producing scores that musicians can use directly, without the need for onerous corrections or revisions. To facilitate future research, all model checkpoints and data are made available to download along with code for the transcription pipeline. Improvements in our modular pipeline could one day make the automatic transcription of complex jazz solos a routine possibility, thereby enriching the resources available for music education and preservation.Multi-label Ferns for Efficient Recognition of Musical Instruments in   Recordings. In this paper we introduce multi-label ferns, and apply this technique for automatic classification of musical instruments in audio recordings. We compare the performance of our proposed method to a set of binary random ferns, using jazz recordings as input data. Our main result is obtaining much faster classification and higher F-score. We also achieve substantial reduction of the model size.Ultrametric Smale's $α$-theory. We present a version of Smale's $\alpha$-theory for ultrametric fields, such as the $p$-adics and their extensions, which gives us a multivariate version of Hensel's lemma.Computational approach to multifractal music. In this work we perform a fractal analysis of 160 pieces of music belonging to six different genres. We show that the majority of the pieces reveal characteristics that allow us to classify them as physical processes called the 1/f (pink) noise. However, this is not true for classical music represented here by Frederic Chopin's works and for some jazz pieces that are much more correlated than the pink noise. We also perform a multifractal (MFDFA) analysis of these music pieces. We show that all the pieces reveal multifractal properties. The richest multifractal structures are observed for pop and rock music. Also the viariably of multifractal features is best visible for popular music genres. This can suggest that, from the multifractal perspective, classical and jazz music is much more uniform than pieces of the most popular genres of music.Maximum entropy models for generation of expressive music. In the context of contemporary monophonic music, expression can be seen as the difference between a musical performance and its symbolic representation, i.e. a musical score. In this paper, we show how Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models can be used to generate musical expression in order to mimic a human performance. As a training corpus, we had a professional pianist play about 150 melodies of jazz, pop, and latin jazz. The results show a good predictive power, validating the choice of our model. Additionally, we set up a listening test whose results reveal that on average, people significantly prefer the melodies generated by the MaxEnt model than the ones without any expression, or with fully random expression. Furthermore, in some cases, MaxEnt melodies are almost as popular as the human performed ones.How do Globally Distributed Agile Teams Self-organise? Initial Insights   from a Case Study. Agile software developers are required to self-organize, occupying various informal roles as needed in order to successfully deliver software features. However, previous research has reported conflicting evidence about the way teams actually undertake this activity. The ability to self-organize is particularly necessary for software development in globally distributed environments, where distance has been shown to exacerbate human-centric issues. Understanding the way successful teams self-organise should inform distributed team composition strategies and software project governance. We have used psycholinguistics to study the way IBM Rational Jazz practitioners enacted various roles, expressed attitudes and shared competencies to successfully self-organize in their global projects. Among our findings, we uncovered that practitioners enacted various roles depending on their teams' cohort of features; and that team leaders were most critical to IBM Jazz teams' self-organisation. We discuss these findings and highlight their implications for software project governance.Jazz Contrafact Detection. In jazz, a contrafact is a new melody composed over an existing, but often reharmonized chord progression. Because reharmonization can introduce a wide range of variations, detecting contrafacts is a challenging task. This paper develops a novel vector-space model to represent chord progressions, and uses it for contrafact detection. The process applies principles from music theory to reduce the dimensionality of chord space, determine a common key signature representation, and compute a chordal co-occurrence matrix. The rows of the matrix form a basis for the vector space in which chord progressions are represented as piecewise linear functions, and harmonic similarity is evaluated by computing the membrane area, a novel distance metric. To illustrate our method's effectiveness, we apply it to the Impro-Visor corpus of 2,612 chord progressions, and present examples demonstrating its ability to account for reharmonizations and find contrafacts.Decoding Musical Evolution Through Network Science. Music has always been central to human culture, reflecting and shaping traditions, emotions, and societal changes. Technological advancements have transformed how music is created and consumed, influencing tastes and the music itself. In this study, we use Network Science to analyze musical complexity. Drawing on $\approx20,000$ MIDI files across six macro-genres spanning nearly four centuries, we represent each composition as a weighted directed network to study its structural properties. Our results show that Classical and Jazz compositions have higher complexity and melodic diversity than recently developed genres. However, a temporal analysis reveals a trend toward simplification, with even Classical and Jazz nearing the complexity levels of modern genres. This study highlights how digital tools and streaming platforms shape musical evolution, fostering new genres while driving homogenization and simplicity.Deconstructing Jazz Piano Style Using Machine Learning. Artistic style has been studied for centuries, and recent advances in machine learning create new possibilities for understanding it computationally. However, ensuring that machine-learning models produce insights aligned with the interests of practitioners and critics remains a significant challenge. Here, we focus on musical style, which benefits from a rich theoretical and mathematical analysis tradition. We train a variety of supervised-learning models to identify 20 iconic jazz musicians across a carefully curated dataset of 84 hours of recordings, and interpret their decision-making processes. Our models include a novel multi-input architecture that enables four musical domains (melody, harmony, rhythm, and dynamics) to be analysed separately. These models enable us to address fundamental questions in music theory and also advance the state-of-the-art in music performer identification (94% accuracy across 20 classes). We release open-source implementations of our models and an accompanying web application for exploring musical styles.Bootstrapping Mirror Pairs: The Beginning of the End. Three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges possess a unique duality known as 3d mirror symmetry. Under this correspondence, the Coulomb branch of one theory is equivalent to the Higgs branch of its mirror dual, and vice versa. Over the past decades, extensive effort has been devoted to charting the landscape of 3d mirror pairs, though progress has often been constrained by the need to identify suitable brane configurations. In this first instalment, we introduce a new quiver-based algorithm, termed Growth and Fusion, which completes a quartet of Higgsing algorithms alongside Decay and Fission, Quiver Subtraction, and Quiver Addition. Together, these four algorithms provide a systematic framework that circumvents the limitations of brane constructions, enabling us to determine the mirror dual of a given quiver and to systematically bootstrap new 3d mirror pairs. We demonstrate the power of this approach on a new class of circular 3d mirror pairs.The True Role of Active Communicators: An Empirical Study of Jazz Core   Developers. Context: Interest in software engineering (SE) methodologies and tools has been complemented in recent years by research efforts oriented towards understanding the human processes involved in software development. This shift has been imperative given reports of inadequately performing teams and the consequent growing emphasis on individuals and team relations in contemporary SE methods. Objective: While software repositories have frequently been studied with a view to explaining such human processes, research has tended to use primarily quantitative analysis approaches. There is concern, however, that such approaches can provide only a partial picture of the software process. Given the way human behavior is nuanced within psychological and social contexts, it has been asserted that a full understanding may only be achieved through deeper contextual enquiries. Method: We have followed such an approach and have applied data mining, SNA, psycholinguistic analysis and directed content analysis (CA) to study the way core developers at IBM Rational Jazz contribute their social and intellectual capital, and have compared the attitudes, interactions and activities of these members to those of their less active counterparts. Results: Among our results, we uncovered that Jazz's core developers worked across multiple roles, and were crucial to their teams' organizational, intra-personal and inter-personal processes. Additionally, although these individuals were highly task- and achievement-focused, they were also largely responsible for maintaining positive team atmosphere, and for providing context awareness in support of their colleagues. Conclusion: Our results suggest that high-performing distributed agile teams rely on both individual and collective efforts, as well as organizational environments that promote informal and organic work structures.(Abridged)Compressible Strips, Chiral Luttinger Liquids and All That Jazz. When the quantum Hall effect occurs in a two-dimensional electron gas, all low-energy elementary excitations are localized near the system edge. The edge acts in many ways like a one-dimensional ring of electrons, except that a finite current flows around the ring in equilibrium. This article is a brief and informal review of some of the physics of quantum Hall system edges. We discuss the implications of macroscopic {\em compressible strip} models for microscopic {chiral Luttinger liquid} models and make an important distinction between the origin of non-Fermi-liquid behavior in fractional quantum Hall edges and in usual one-dimensional electron gas systems.Graphene, Nobel Prize and All that Jazz. Graphene, a single atomic layer of graphite, first isolated in 2004, has made a quantum leap in the exploration of the physics of two-dimensional electron systems. Since the initial report of its discovery, many thousands of papers have been published, attempting to explain every aspect of the exotic electronic properties of this system. The graphene euphoria has culminated with the 2010 Nobel Prize in physics being awarded jointly to Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov of the University of Manchester, UK, "for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene". But, what are the properties of graphene, and how was it made? Why it is so exciting for so many researchers, and why the Nobel Prize?SOI RF Switch for Wireless Sensor Network. The objective of this research was to design a 0-5 GHz RF SOI switch, with 0.18um power Jazz SOI technology by using Cadence software, for health care applications. This paper introduces the design of a RF switch implemented in shunt-series topology. An insertion loss of 0.906 dB and an isolation of 30.95 dB were obtained at 5 GHz. The switch also achieved a third order distortion of 53.05 dBm and 1 dB compression point reached 50.06dBm. The RF switch performance meets the desired specification requirements.Multifractal Spin-Glass Chaos Projection and Interrelation of   Multicultural Music and Brain Signals. A complexity classification scheme is developed from the fractal spectra of spin-glass chaos and demonstrated with multigeographic multicultural music and brain electroencephalogram signals. Systematic patterns are found to emerge. Chaos under scale change is the essence of spin-glass ordering and can be obtained, continuously tailor-made, from the exact renormalization-group solution of Ising models on frustrated hierarchical lattices. The music pieces are from Turkish music, namely Arabesque, Rap, Pop, Classical, and Western music, namely Blues, Jazz, Pop, Classical. A surprising group defection occurs.An Exploratory Study of Multimodal Physiological Data in Jazz   Improvisation Using Basic Machine Learning Techniques. Our study delves into the "Embodied Musicking Dataset," exploring the intertwined relationships and correlations between physiological and psychological dimensions during improvisational music performances. The primary objective is to ascertain the presence of a definitive causal or correlational relationship between these states and comprehend their manifestation in musical compositions. This rich dataset provides a perspective on how musicians coordinate their physicality with sonic events in real-time improvisational scenarios, emphasizing the concept of "Embodied Musicking."Exploring the links between software development task type, team   attitudes and task completion performance: Insights from the Jazz repository. Context: In seeking to better understand the impact of various human factors in software development, and how teams' attitudes relate to their performance, increasing attention is being given to the study of team-related artefacts. In particular, researchers have conducted numerous studies on a range of team communication channels to explore links between developers' language use and the incidence of software bugs in the products they delivered. Comparatively limited attention has been paid, however, to the full range of software tasks that are commonly performed during the development and delivery of software systems, in spite of compelling evidence pointing to the need to understand teams' attitudes more widely. Objective: We were therefore motivated to study the relationships between task type and team attitudes, and how attitudes expressed in teams' communications might be related to their task completion performance when undertaking a range of activities. Method: Our investigation involved artefacts from 474 IBM Jazz practitioners assembled in 149 teams working on around 30,000 software development tasks over a three-year period. We applied linguistic analysis, standard statistical techniques and directed content analysis to address our research objective. Results: Our evidence revealed that teams expressed different attitudes when working on various forms of software tasks, and they were particularly emotional when working to remedy defects. That said, teams' expression of attitudes was not found to be a strong predictor of their task completion performance. Conclusion: Efforts aimed at reducing bug incidence may positively limit teams' emotional disposition when resolving bugs, thereby reducing the otherwise high demand for emotionally stable members. (Abridged)Contextual Linear Types for Differential Privacy. Language support for differentially-private programming is both crucial and delicate. While elaborate program logics can be very expressive, type-system based approaches using linear types tend to be more lightweight and amenable to automatic checking and inference, and in particular in the presence of higher-order programming. Since the seminal design of Fuzz, which is restricted to $\epsilon$-differential privacy in its original design, significant progress has been made to support more advancedvariants of differential privacy, like($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-differential privacy. However, supporting these advanced privacy variants while also supporting higher-order programming in full has proven to be challenging. We present Jazz, a language and type system which uses linear types and latent contextual effects to support both advanced variants of differential privacy and higher-order programming. Latent contextual effects allow delaying the payment of effects for connectives such as products, sums and functions, yielding advantages in terms of precision of the analysis and annotation burden upon elimination, as well as modularity. We formalize the core of Jazz, prove it sound for privacy via a logical relation for metric preservation, and illustrate its expressive power through a number of case studies drawn from the recent differential privacy literature.What Affects Team Behavior? Preliminary Linguistic Analysis of   Communications in the Jazz Repository. There is a growing belief that understanding and addressing the human processes employed during software development is likely to provide substantially more value to industry than yet more recommendations for the implementation of various methods and tools. To this end, considerable research effort has been dedicated to studying human issues as represented in software artifacts, due to its relatively unobtrusive nature. We have followed this line of research and have conducted a preliminary study of team behaviors using data mining techniques and linguistic analysis. Our data source, the IBM Rational Jazz repository, was mined and data from three different project areas were extracted. Communications in these projects were then analyzed using the LIWC linguistic analysis tool. We found that although there are some variations in language use among teams working on project areas dedicated to different software outcomes, project type and the mix of (and number of) individuals involved did not affect team behaviors as evident in their communications. These assessments are initial conjectures, however; we plan further exploratory analysis to validate these results. We explain these findings and discuss their implications for software engineering practice.Shaping the Epochal Individuality and Generality: The Temporal Dynamics   of Uncertainty and Prediction Error in Musical Improvisation. Musical improvisation, much like spontaneous speech, reveals intricate facets of the improviser's state of mind and emotional character. However, the specific musical components that reveal such individuality remain largely unexplored. Within the framework of brain's statistical learning and predictive processing, this study examined the temporal dynamics of uncertainty and surprise (prediction error) in a piece of musical improvisation. This study employed the HBSL model to analyze a corpus of 456 Jazz improvisations, spanning 1905 to 2009, from 78 distinct Jazz musicians. The results indicated distinctive temporal patterns of surprise and uncertainty, especially in pitch and pitch-rhythm sequences, revealing era-specific features from the early 20th to the 21st centuries. Conversely, rhythm sequences exhibited a consistent degree of uncertainty across eras. Further, the acoustic properties remain unchanged across different periods. These findings highlight the importance of how temporal dynamics of surprise and uncertainty in improvisational music change over periods, profoundly influencing the distinctive methodologies artists adopt for improvisation in each era. Further, it is suggested that the development of improvisational music can be attributed to the brain's adaptive statistical learning mechanisms, which constantly refine internal models to mirror the cultural and emotional nuances of their respective epochs. This study unravels the evolutionary trajectory of improvisational music and highlights the nuanced shifts artists employ to resonate with the cultural and emotional landscapes of their times.ImprovNet -- Generating Controllable Musical Improvisations with   Iterative Corruption Refinement. Despite deep learning's remarkable advances in style transfer across various domains, generating controllable performance-level musical style transfer for complete symbolically represented musical works remains a challenging area of research. Much of this is owed to limited datasets, especially for genres such as jazz, and the lack of unified models that can handle multiple music generation tasks. This paper presents ImprovNet, a transformer-based architecture that generates expressive and controllable musical improvisations through a self-supervised corruption-refinement training strategy. The improvisational style transfer is aimed at making meaningful modifications to one or more musical elements - melody, harmony or rhythm of the original composition with respect to the target genre. ImprovNet unifies multiple capabilities within a single model: it can perform cross-genre and intra-genre improvisations, harmonize melodies with genre-specific styles, and execute short prompt continuation and infilling tasks. The model's iterative generation framework allows users to control the degree of style transfer and structural similarity to the original composition. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate ImprovNet's effectiveness in generating musically coherent improvisations while maintaining structural relationships with the original pieces. The model outperforms Anticipatory Music Transformer in short continuation and infilling tasks and successfully achieves recognizable genre conversion, with 79\% of participants correctly identifying jazz-style improvisations of classical pieces. Our code and demo page can be found at https://github.com/keshavbhandari/improvnet.Different amplitude and time distribution of the sound of light and   classical music. Several pieces of different musical kinds were studied measuring $N(A)$, the output amplitude of a peak detector driven by the electric signal arriving to the loudspeaker. Fixed a suitable threshold $\bar{A}$, we considered $N(A)$, the number of times that $A(t)>\bar{A}$, each of them we named event and $N(t)$, the distribution of times $t$ between two consecutive events. Some $N(A)$ and $N(t)$ distributions are displayed in the reported logarithmic plots, showing that jazz, pop, rock and other popular rhythms have noise-distribution, while classical pieces of music are characterized by more complex statistics. We pointed out the extraordinary case of the aria ``\textit{La calunnia \`{e} un venticello}'', where the words describe an avalanche or seismic process, calumny, and the rossinian music shows $N(A)$ and $N(t)$ distribution typical of earthquakes.Social network from communities of electronic mail. Social networks are analyzed as graphs under the scope of discrete mathematics which have a great range of applications in different contexts such as: technology, social phenomena and biological systems. At the present this theory gives a set of tools for a phenomenological analysis that would be difficult or almost impossible with a different approach. In this work social networks for different technical communities from electronic mail and ``News'' in Spanish language are constructed. The algorithm was based on the use of RFC2822 standards and RFC1036 to arm threads of messages. The results are quite different from that obtained by another kind of community as the jazz musicians community. Nevertheless they show an analogy to random graphs obtained by the ``Configuration Model'' method. This points the attention that some generalization assumptions are not correct.Eclipse-IT 2013: Proceedings of VIII Workshop of the Italian Eclipse   Community. This volume contains the extended abstracts of the contributions presented at EclipseIT 2013, the 8th workshop of the Italian Eclipse Community, hosted by the Computer Science Department of the University of Milan (Crema Campus) on September 19-20, 2013. Although Eclipse was initially designed as an integrated development environment (IDE) for object-oriented application development, today it represents an open development platform comprised of extensible frameworks, tools and runtimes for building, deploying and managing software. Around Eclipse, an international live community continuously works on improving the framework and on promoting the use of Eclipse. That happens also in Italy. This workshop is, indeed, the eighth yearly meeting of the Italian Eclipse Community which includes universities, public institutions and industries, researchers and practitioners, students and professionals, all joined by the interest in experimenting, extending, and supporting the Eclipse platform. The special topic of this edition is the Software cooperative development for mobile applications. Two tutorials are offered on this theme: (1) Sviluppo di applicazioni enterprise per il mobile con IBM Jazz, Eclipse e Worklight by Ferdinando Gorga from IBM, and (2) Uso di Eclipse per lo sviluppo cooperativo del software, by Paolo Maresca of the University of Naples, Federico II.Mining developer communication data streams. This paper explores the concepts of modelling a software development project as a process that results in the creation of a continuous stream of data. In terms of the Jazz repository used in this research, one aspect of that stream of data would be developer communication. Such data can be used to create an evolving social network characterized by a range of metrics. This paper presents the application of data stream mining techniques to identify the most useful metrics for predicting build outcomes. Results are presented from applying the Hoeffding Tree classification method used in conjunction with the Adaptive Sliding Window (ADWIN) method for detecting concept drift. The results indicate that only a small number of the available metrics considered have any significance for predicting the outcome of a build.From vertex detectors to inner trackers with CMOS pixel sensors. The use of CMOS Pixel Sensors (CPS) for high resolution and low material vertex detectors has been validated with the 2014 and 2015 physics runs of the STAR-PXL detector at RHIC/BNL. This opens the door to the use of CPS for inner tracking devices, with 10-100 times larger sensitive area, which require therefore a sensor design privileging power saving, response uniformity and robustness. The 350 nm CMOS technology used for the STAR-PXL sensors was considered as too poorly suited to upcoming applications like the upgraded ALICE Inner Tracking System (ITS), which requires sensors with one order of magnitude improvement on readout speed and improved radiation tolerance. This triggered the exploration of a deeper sub-micron CMOS technology, Tower-Jazz 180 nm, for the design of a CPS well adapted for the new ALICE-ITS running conditions. This paper reports the R&D results for the conception of a CPS well adapted for the ALICE-ITS.You Are What You Eat... Listen to, Watch, and Read. This article describes a data driven method for deriving the relationship between personality and media preferences. A qunatifiable representation of such a relationship can be leveraged for use in recommendation systems and ameliorate the "cold start" problem. Here, the data is comprised of an original collection of 1,316 Okcupid dating profiles. Of these profiles, 800 are labeled with one of 16 possible Myers-Briggs Type Indicators (MBTI). A personality specific topic model describing a person's favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food was generated using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). There were several significant findings, for example, intuitive thinking types preferred sci-fi/fantasy entertainment, extraversion correlated positively with upbeat dance music, and jazz, folk, and international cuisine correlated positively with those characterized by openness to experience. Many other correlations confirmed previous findings describing the relationship among personality, writing style, and personal preferences. (For complete word/personality type assocations see the Appendix).Low Power SI Class E Power Amplifier and RF Switch For Health Care. This research was to design a 2.4 GHz class E Power Amplifier (PA) for health care, with 0.18um Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation CMOS technology by using Cadence software. And also RF switch was designed at cadence software with power Jazz 180nm SOI process. The ultimate goal for such application is to reach high performance and low cost, and between high performance and low power consumption design. This paper introduces the design of a 2.4GHz class E power amplifier and RF switch design. PA consists of cascade stage with negative capacitance. This power amplifier can transmit 16dBm output power to a 50{\Omega} load. The performance of the power amplifier and switch meet the specification requirements of the desired.Taste or Addiction?: Using Play Logs to Infer Song Selection Motivation. Online music services are increasing in popularity. They enable us to analyze people's music listening behavior based on play logs. Although it is known that people listen to music based on topic (e.g., rock or jazz), we assume that when a user is addicted to an artist, s/he chooses the artist's songs regardless of topic. Based on this assumption, in this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to analyze people's music listening behavior. Our main contributions are three-fold. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study modeling music listening behavior by taking into account the influence of addiction to artists. Second, by using real-world datasets of play logs, we showed the effectiveness of our proposed model. Third, we carried out qualitative experiments and showed that taking addiction into account enables us to analyze music listening behavior from a new viewpoint in terms of how people listen to music according to the time of day, how an artist's songs are listened to by people, etc. We also discuss the possibility of applying the analysis results to applications such as artist similarity computation and song recommendation.An energy-based generative sequence model for testing sensory theories   of Western harmony. The relationship between sensory consonance and Western harmony is an important topic in music theory and psychology. We introduce new methods for analysing this relationship, and apply them to large corpora representing three prominent genres of Western music: classical, popular, and jazz music. These methods centre on a generative sequence model with an exponential-family energy-based form that predicts chord sequences from continuous features. We use this model to investigate one aspect of instantaneous consonance (harmonicity) and two aspects of sequential consonance (spectral distance and voice-leading distance). Applied to our three musical genres, the results generally support the relationship between sensory consonance and harmony, but lead us to question the high importance attributed to spectral distance in the psychological literature. We anticipate that our methods will provide a useful platform for future work linking music psychology to music theory.MIDI-VAE: Modeling Dynamics and Instrumentation of Music with   Applications to Style Transfer. We introduce MIDI-VAE, a neural network model based on Variational Autoencoders that is capable of handling polyphonic music with multiple instrument tracks, as well as modeling the dynamics of music by incorporating note durations and velocities. We show that MIDI-VAE can perform style transfer on symbolic music by automatically changing pitches, dynamics and instruments of a music piece from, e.g., a Classical to a Jazz style. We evaluate the efficacy of the style transfer by training separate style validation classifiers. Our model can also interpolate between short pieces of music, produce medleys and create mixtures of entire songs. The interpolations smoothly change pitches, dynamics and instrumentation to create a harmonic bridge between two music pieces. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful attempt at applying neural style transfer to complete musical compositions.Scorpiano -- A System for Automatic Music Transcription for Monophonic   Piano Music. Music transcription is the process of transcribing music audio into music notation. It is a field in which the machines still cannot beat human performance. The main motivation for automatic music transcription is to make it possible for anyone playing a musical instrument, to be able to generate the music notes for a piece of music quickly and accurately. It does not matter if the person is a beginner and simply struggles to find the music score by searching, or an expert who heard a live jazz improvisation and would like to reproduce it without losing time doing manual transcription. We propose Scorpiano -- a system that can automatically generate a music score for simple monophonic piano melody tracks using digital signal processing. The system integrates multiple digital audio processing methods: notes onset detection, tempo estimation, beat detection, pitch detection and finally generation of the music score. The system has proven to give good results for simple piano melodies, comparable to commercially available neural network based systems.Wykorzystanie sztucznej inteligencji do generowania treści muzycznych. This thesis is presenting a method for generating short musical phrases using a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). To train neural network were used datasets of classical and jazz music MIDI recordings. Our approach introduces translating the MIDI data into graphical images in a piano roll format suitable for the network input size, using the RGB channels as additional information carriers for improved performance. The network has learned to generate images that are indistinguishable from the input data and, when translated back to MIDI and played back, include several musically interesting rhythmic and harmonic structures. The results of the conducted experiments are described and discussed, with conclusions for further work and a short comparison with selected existing solutions.Attentional networks for music generation. Realistic music generation has always remained as a challenging problem as it may lack structure or rationality. In this work, we propose a deep learning based music generation method in order to produce old style music particularly JAZZ with rehashed melodic structures utilizing a Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) Neural Network with Attention. Owing to the success in modelling long-term temporal dependencies in sequential data and its success in case of videos, Bi-LSTMs with attention serve as the natural choice and early utilization in music generation. We validate in our experiments that Bi-LSTMs with attention are able to preserve the richness and technical nuances of the music performed.Music Genre Bars. Music Genres, as a popular meta-data of music, are very useful to organize, explore or search music datasets. Soft music genres are weighted multiple-genre annotations to songs. In this initial work, we propose horizontally stacked bar charts to represent a music dataset annotated by these soft music genres. For this purpose, we take an example of a toy dataset consisting of songs labelled with help of three music genres; Blues, Jazz and Country. We demonstrate how such a stacked bar chart can be used as a slider for user-input in an interface. We implement this by embedding this genre bar in a streaming application prototype and show its utility in choosing playlists. We finally conclude by proposing further work and future explorations on our proposed preliminary research.CMOS pixel sensors optimized for large ionizing dynamic. Monolithic active pixel sensors (MAPS) are now well established as a technology for tracking charged particles, especially when low material budget is desirable. For such applications, sensors focus on spatial resolution and pixels with digital output or modest charge measurement ability are well suited. Within the European Union STRONG-2020 project, which focuses on experiments using hadrons, the TIIMM (Tracking and Ions Identifications with Minimal Material budget) joint research activity intends to expand granular MAPS capacity to energy-loss ({\Delta}E) measurement for ion species identification. The TIIMM prototypes are developed in the Tower Jazz 180 nm CMOS image sensor (CIS) process. The Time-Over-Threshold (ToT) method is applied to the sensor for the energy-loss measurement. The main design details and the preliminary test results from laboratory measurements of the initial TIIMM prototype are presented in this work.JaCappella Corpus: A Japanese a Cappella Vocal Ensemble Corpus. We construct a corpus of Japanese a cappella vocal ensembles (jaCappella corpus) for vocal ensemble separation and synthesis. It consists of 35 copyright-cleared vocal ensemble songs and their audio recordings of individual voice parts. These songs were arranged from out-of-copyright Japanese children's songs and have six voice parts (lead vocal, soprano, alto, tenor, bass, and vocal percussion). They are divided into seven subsets, each of which features typical characteristics of a music genre such as jazz and enka. The variety in genre and voice part match vocal ensembles recently widespread in social media services such as YouTube, although the main targets of conventional vocal ensemble datasets are choral singing made up of soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our corpus is a challenging resource for vocal ensemble separation. Our corpus is available on our project page (https://tomohikonakamura.github.io/jaCappella_corpus/).jazznet: A Dataset of Fundamental Piano Patterns for Music Audio Machine   Learning Research. This paper introduces the jazznet Dataset, a dataset of fundamental jazz piano music patterns for developing machine learning (ML) algorithms in music information retrieval (MIR). The dataset contains 162520 labeled piano patterns, including chords, arpeggios, scales, and chord progressions with their inversions, resulting in more than 26k hours of audio and a total size of 95GB. The paper explains the dataset's composition, creation, and generation, and presents an open-source Pattern Generator using a method called Distance-Based Pattern Structures (DBPS), which allows researchers to easily generate new piano patterns simply by defining the distances between pitches within the musical patterns. We demonstrate that the dataset can help researchers benchmark new models for challenging MIR tasks, using a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) and a deep convolutional neural network. The dataset and code are available via: https://github.com/tosiron/jazznet.A2D: Anywhere Anytime Drumming. The drum kit, which has only been around for around 100 years, is a popular instrument in many music genres such as pop, rock, and jazz. However, the road to owning a kit is expensive, both financially and space-wise. Also, drums are more difficult to move around compared to other instruments, as they do not fit into a single bag. We propose a no-drums approach that uses only two sticks and a smartphone or a webcam to provide an air-drumming experience. The detection algorithm combines deep learning tools with tracking methods for an enhanced user experience. Based on both quantitative and qualitative testing with humans-in-the-loop, we show that our system has zero misses for beginner level play and negligible misses for advanced level play. Additionally, our limited human trials suggest potential directions for future research.Predicting Music Hierarchies with a Graph-Based Neural Decoder. This paper describes a data-driven framework to parse musical sequences into dependency trees, which are hierarchical structures used in music cognition research and music analysis. The parsing involves two steps. First, the input sequence is passed through a transformer encoder to enrich it with contextual information. Then, a classifier filters the graph of all possible dependency arcs to produce the dependency tree. One major benefit of this system is that it can be easily integrated into modern deep-learning pipelines. Moreover, since it does not rely on any particular symbolic grammar, it can consider multiple musical features simultaneously, make use of sequential context information, and produce partial results for noisy inputs. We test our approach on two datasets of musical trees -- time-span trees of monophonic note sequences and harmonic trees of jazz chord sequences -- and show that our approach outperforms previous methods.Binaural recording methods with analysis on inter-aural time, level, and   phase differences. Binaural recordings are a form of stereophonic recording method that replicates how human ears perceive sound, these types of recordings create a 3D aural image around the listener and are extremely immersive when well recorded and listened to appropriately with headphones. It has wide applications in video, podcast, and gaming formats -- allowing the listener to feel like they are there. Although binaural formats are seldom used for music applications, they have also been utilized in music ranging from Rock, Jazz, Acoustic, and Classical. In this paper, we will investigate the acoustical phenomenon that produces the binaural effect in audio recordings -- including the ITD (Inter-aural time difference), the ILD (inter-aural level difference), IPD (inter-aural phase difference) as well as the monaural spectral difference that occurs between two ears so we can better understand the replication of human hearing in binaural recordings. Binaural recordings differ from regular stereophonic recordings as they are arranged in a specific way to account for HRTF (Head-related transfer function). The most common method of binaural recordings is with two high-quality omni-directional microphones affixed on a dummy head where the ears are located, although other methods exist without the use of a full dummy head.A Survey of Music Generation in the Context of Interaction. In recent years, machine learning, and in particular generative adversarial neural networks (GANs) and attention-based neural networks (transformers), have been successfully used to compose and generate music, both melodies and polyphonic pieces. Current research focuses foremost on style replication (eg. generating a Bach-style chorale) or style transfer (eg. classical to jazz) based on large amounts of recorded or transcribed music, which in turn also allows for fairly straight-forward "performance" evaluation. However, most of these models are not suitable for human-machine co-creation through live interaction, neither is clear, how such models and resulting creations would be evaluated. This article presents a thorough review of music representation, feature analysis, heuristic algorithms, statistical and parametric modelling, and human and automatic evaluation measures, along with a discussion of which approaches and models seem most suitable for live interaction.Audio Processing using Pattern Recognition for Music Genre   Classification. This project explores the application of machine learning techniques for music genre classification using the GTZAN dataset, which contains 100 audio files per genre. Motivated by the growing demand for personalized music recommendations, we focused on classifying five genres-Blues, Classical, Jazz, Hip Hop, and Country-using a variety of algorithms including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) implemented via Keras. The ANN model demonstrated the best performance, achieving a validation accuracy of 92.44%. We also analyzed key audio features such as spectral roll-off, spectral centroid, and MFCCs, which helped enhance the model's accuracy. Future work will expand the model to cover all ten genres, investigate advanced methods like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and ensemble approaches, and develop a web application for real-time genre classification and playlist generation. This research aims to contribute to improving music recommendation systems and content curation.Designing AI-Enabled Countermeasures to Cognitive Warfare. Foreign information operations on social media platforms pose significant risks to democratic societies. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), this threat is likely to intensify, potentially overwhelming human defenders. To achieve the necessary scale and tempo to defend against these threats, utilizing AI as part of the solution seems inevitable. Although there has been a significant debate on AI in Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS), it is equally likely that AI will be widely used in information operations for defensive and offensive objectives. Similar to LAWS, AI-driven information operations occupy a highly sensitive moral domain where removing human involvement in the tactical decision making process raises ethical concerns. Although AI has yet to revolutionize the field, a solid ethical stance is urgently needed on how AI can be responsibly used to defend against information operations on social media platforms. This paper proposes possible AI-enabled countermeasures against cognitive warfare and argues how they can be developed in a responsible way, such that meaningful human control is preserved.Robot Drummer: Learning Rhythmic Skills for Humanoid Drumming. Humanoid robots have seen remarkable advances in dexterity, balance, and locomotion, yet their role in expressive domains such as music performance remains largely unexplored. Musical tasks, like drumming, present unique challenges, including split-second timing, rapid contacts, and multi-limb coordination over performances lasting minutes. In this paper, we introduce Robot Drummer, a humanoid capable of expressive, high-precision drumming across a diverse repertoire of songs. We formulate humanoid drumming as sequential fulfillment of timed contacts and transform drum scores into a Rhythmic Contact Chain. To handle the long-horizon nature of musical performance, we decompose each piece into fixed-length segments and train a single policy across all segments in parallel using reinforcement learning. Through extensive experiments on over thirty popular rock, metal, and jazz tracks, our results demonstrate that Robot Drummer consistently achieves high F1 scores. The learned behaviors exhibit emergent human-like drumming strategies, such as cross-arm strikes, and adaptive stick assignments, demonstrating the potential of reinforcement learning to bring humanoid robots into the domain of creative musical performance. Project page: robotdrummer.github.ioOrchestration of Music by Grammar Systems. This application-oriented study concerns computational musicology, which makes use of grammar systems. We define multi-generative rule-synchronized scattered-context grammar systems (without erasing rules) and demonstrates how to simultaneously make the arrangement of a musical composition for performance by a whole orchestra, consisting of several instruments. Primarily, an orchestration like this is illustrated by examples in terms of classical music. In addition, the orchestration of jazz compositions is sketched as well. The study concludes its discussion by suggesting five open problem areas related to this way of orchestration.MusiCRS: Benchmarking Audio-Centric Conversational Recommendation. Conversational recommendation has advanced rapidly with large language models (LLMs), yet music remains a uniquely challenging domain where effective recommendations require reasoning over audio content beyond what text or metadata can capture. We present MusiCRS, the first benchmark for audio-centric conversational recommendation that links authentic user conversations from Reddit with corresponding audio tracks. MusiCRS contains 477 high-quality conversations spanning diverse genres (classical, hip-hop, electronic, metal, pop, indie, jazz) with 3,589 unique musical entities and audio grounding via YouTube links. MusiCRS enables evaluation across three input modality configurations: audio-only, query-only, and audio+query (multimodal), allowing systematic comparison of audio-LLMs, retrieval models, and traditional approaches. Our experiments reveal that current systems rely heavily on textual signals and struggle with nuanced audio reasoning. This exposes fundamental limitations in cross-modal knowledge integration where models excel at dialogue semantics but cannot effectively ground abstract musical concepts in actual audio content. To facilitate progress, we release the MusiCRS dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/rohan2810/MusiCRS), evaluation code (https://github.com/rohan2810/musiCRS), and comprehensive baselines.A Graph Engine for Guitar Chord-Tone Soloing Education. We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.Identifying Cover Songs Using Information-Theoretic Measures of   Similarity. This paper investigates methods for quantifying similarity between audio signals, specifically for the task of of cover song detection. We consider an information-theoretic approach, where we compute pairwise measures of predictability between time series. We compare discrete-valued approaches operating on quantised audio features, to continuous-valued approaches. In the discrete case, we propose a method for computing the normalised compression distance, where we account for correlation between time series. In the continuous case, we propose to compute information-based measures of similarity as statistics of the prediction error between time series. We evaluate our methods on two cover song identification tasks using a data set comprised of 300 Jazz standards and using the Million Song Dataset. For both datasets, we observe that continuous-valued approaches outperform discrete-valued approaches. We consider approaches to estimating the normalised compression distance (NCD) based on string compression and prediction, where we observe that our proposed normalised compression distance with alignment (NCDA) improves average performance over NCD, for sequential compression algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate that continuous-valued distances may be combined to improve performance with respect to baseline approaches. Using a large-scale filter-and-refine approach, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for cover song identification using the Million Song Dataset.Headphones on the wire. We analyze a dataset providing the complete information on the effective plays of thousands of music listeners during several months. Our analysis confirms a number of properties previously highlighted by research based on interviews and questionnaires, but also uncover new statistical patterns, both at the individual and collective levels. In particular, we show that individuals follow common listening rhythms characterized by the same fluctuations, alternating heavy and light listening periods, and can be classified in four groups of similar sizes according to their temporal habits --- 'early birds', 'working hours listeners', 'evening listeners' and 'night owls'. We provide a detailed radioscopy of the listeners' interplay between repeated listening and discovery of new content. We show that different genres encourage different listening habits, from Classical or Jazz music with a more balanced listening among different songs, to Hip Hop and Dance with a more heterogeneous distribution of plays. Finally, we provide measures of how distant people are from each other in terms of common songs. In particular, we show that the number of songs $S$ a DJ should play to a random audience of size $N$ such that everyone hears at least one song he/she currently listens to, is of the form $S\sim N^\alpha$ where the exponent depends on the music genre and is in the range $[0.5,0.8]$. More generally, our results show that the recent access to virtually infinite catalogs of songs does not promote exploration for novelty, but that most users favor repetition of the same songs.Evaluating language models of tonal harmony. This study borrows and extends probabilistic language models from natural language processing to discover the syntactic properties of tonal harmony. Language models come in many shapes and sizes, but their central purpose is always the same: to predict the next event in a sequence of letters, words, notes, or chords. However, few studies employing such models have evaluated the most state-of-the-art architectures using a large-scale corpus of Western tonal music, instead preferring to use relatively small datasets containing chord annotations from contemporary genres like jazz, pop, and rock.   Using symbolic representations of prominent instrumental genres from the common-practice period, this study applies a flexible, data-driven encoding scheme to (1) evaluate Finite Context (or n-gram) models and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in a chord prediction task; (2) compare predictive accuracy from the best-performing models for chord onsets from each of the selected datasets; and (3) explain differences between the two model architectures in a regression analysis. We find that Finite Context models using the Prediction by Partial Match (PPM) algorithm outperform RNNs, particularly for the piano datasets, with the regression model suggesting that RNNs struggle with particularly rare chord types.Multi-Step Chord Sequence Prediction Based on Aggregated Multi-Scale   Encoder-Decoder Network. This paper studies the prediction of chord progressions for jazz music by relying on machine learning models. The motivation of our study comes from the recent success of neural networks for performing automatic music composition. Although high accuracies are obtained in single-step prediction scenarios, most models fail to generate accurate multi-step chord predictions. In this paper, we postulate that this comes from the multi-scale structure of musical information and propose new architectures based on an iterative temporal aggregation of input labels. Specifically, the input and ground truth labels are merged into increasingly large temporal bags, on which we train a family of encoder-decoder networks for each temporal scale. In a second step, we use these pre-trained encoder bottleneck features at each scale in order to train a final encoder-decoder network. Furthermore, we rely on different reductions of the initial chord alphabet into three adapted chord alphabets. We perform evaluations against several state-of-the-art models and show that our multi-scale architecture outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and perplexity, while requiring relatively few parameters. We analyze musical properties of the results, showing the influence of downbeat position within the analysis window on accuracy, and evaluate errors using a musically-informed distance metric.Mining Hidden Populations through Attributed Search. Researchers often query online social platforms through their application programming interfaces (API) to find target populations such as people with mental illness~\cite{De-Choudhury2017} and jazz musicians~\cite{heckathorn2001finding}. Entities of such target population satisfy a property that is typically identified using an oracle (human or a pre-trained classifier). When the property of the target entities is not directly queryable via the API, we refer to the property as `hidden' and the population as a hidden population. Finding individuals who belong to these populations on social networks is hard because they are non-queryable, and the sampler has to explore from a combinatorial query space within a finite budget limit. By exploiting the correlation between queryable attributes and the population of interest and by hierarchically ordering the query space, we propose a Decision tree-based Thompson sampler (\texttt{DT-TMP}) that efficiently discovers the right combination of attributes to query. Our proposed sampler outperforms the state-of-the-art samplers in online experiments, for example by 54\% on Twitter. When the number of matching entities to a query is known in offline experiments, \texttt{DT-TMP} performs exceedingly well by a factor of 0.9-1.5$\times$ over the baseline samplers. In the future, we wish to explore the option of finding hidden populations by formulating more complex queries.End-to-end Music-mixed Speech Recognition. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) in multimedia content is one of the promising applications, but speech data in this kind of content are frequently mixed with background music, which is harmful for the performance of ASR. In this study, we propose a method for improving ASR with background music based on time-domain source separation. We utilize Conv-TasNet as a separation network, which has achieved state-of-the-art performance for multi-speaker source separation, to extract the speech signal from a speech-music mixture in the waveform domain. We also propose joint fine-tuning of a pre-trained Conv-TasNet front-end with an attention-based ASR back-end using both separation and ASR objectives. We evaluated our method through ASR experiments using speech data mixed with background music from a wide variety of Japanese animations. We show that time-domain speech-music separation drastically improves ASR performance of the back-end model trained with mixture data, and the joint optimization yielded a further significant WER reduction. The time-domain separation method outperformed a frequency-domain separation method, which reuses the phase information of the input mixture signal, both in simple cascading and joint training settings. We also demonstrate that our method works robustly for music interference from classical, jazz and popular genres.Personality Profiles of Global Software Developers. Context: Individuals' personality traits have been shown to influence their behavior during team work. In particular, positive group attitudes are said to be essential for distributed and global software development efforts where collaboration is critical to project success. Objective: Given this, we have sought to study the influence of global software practitioners' personality profiles from a psycholinguistic perspective. Method: Artifacts from ten teams were selected from the IBM Rational Jazz repository and mined. We employed social network analysis (SNA) techniques to identify and group practitioners into two clusters based on the numbers of messages they communicated, Top Members and Others, and used standard statistical techniques to assess practitioners' engagement in task changes associated with work items. We then performed psycholinguistic analysis on practitioners' messages using linguistic dimensions of the LIWC tool that had been previously correlated with the Big Five personality profiles. Results: For our sample of 146 practitioners, we found that the Top Members demonstrated more openness to experience than the Other practitioners. Additionally, practitioners involved in usability-related tasks were found to be highly extroverted, and coders were most neurotic and conscientious. Conclusion: High levels of organizational and inter-personal skills may be useful for those operating in distributed settings, and personality diversity is likely to boost team performance.Communication and Personality Profiles of Global Software Developers. Context: Prior research has established that a small proportion of individuals dominate team communication during global software development. It is not known, however, how these members' contributions affect their teams' knowledge diffusion process, or whether their personality profiles are responsible for their dominant presence. Objective: We set out to address this gap through the study of repository artifacts. Method: Artifacts from ten teams were mined from the IBM Rational Jazz repository. We employed social network analysis (SNA) to group practitioners into two clusters, Top Members and Others, based on the numbers of messages they communicated and their engagement in task changes. SNA metrics (density, in-degree and closeness) were then used to study practitioners' importance in knowledge diffusion. Thereafter, we performed psycholinguistic analysis on practitioners' messages using linguistic dimensions that had been previously correlated with the Big Five personality profiles. Results: For our sample of 146 practitioners we found that Top Members occupied critical roles in knowledge diffusion, and demonstrated more openness to experience than the Others. Additionally, all personality profiles were represented during teamwork, although openness to experience, agreeableness and extroversion were particularly evident. However, no specific personality predicted members' involvement in knowledge diffusion. Conclusion: Task assignment that promotes highly connected team communication networks may mitigate tacit knowledge loss in global software teams. Additionally, while members expressing openness to experience are likely to be particularly driven to perform, this is not entirely responsible for a global team's success.Catch-A-Waveform: Learning to Generate Audio from a Single Short Example. Models for audio generation are typically trained on hours of recordings. Here, we illustrate that capturing the essence of an audio source is typically possible from as little as a few tens of seconds from a single training signal. Specifically, we present a GAN-based generative model that can be trained on one short audio signal from any domain (e.g. speech, music, etc.) and does not require pre-training or any other form of external supervision. Once trained, our model can generate random samples of arbitrary duration that maintain semantic similarity to the training waveform, yet exhibit new compositions of its audio primitives. This enables a long line of interesting applications, including generating new jazz improvisations or new a-cappella rap variants based on a single short example, producing coherent modifications to famous songs (e.g. adding a new verse to a Beatles song based solely on the original recording), filling-in of missing parts (inpainting), extending the bandwidth of a speech signal (super-resolution), and enhancing old recordings without access to any clean training example. We show that in all cases, no more than 20 seconds of training audio commonly suffice for our model to achieve state-of-the-art results. This is despite its complete lack of prior knowledge about the nature of audio signals in general.Uncovering implementable dormant pruning decisions from three different   stakeholder perspectives. Dormant pruning, or the removal of unproductive portions of a tree while a tree is not actively growing, is an important orchard task to help maintain yield, requiring years to build expertise. Because of long training periods and an increasing labor shortage in agricultural jobs, pruning could benefit from robotic automation. However, to program robots to prune branches, we first need to understand how pruning decisions are made, and what variables in the environment (e.g., branch size and thickness) we need to capture. Working directly with three pruning stakeholders -- horticulturists, growers, and pruners -- we find that each group of human experts approaches pruning decision-making differently. To capture this knowledge, we present three studies and two extracted pruning protocols from field work conducted in Prosser, Washington in January 2022 and 2023. We interviewed six stakeholders (two in each group) and observed pruning across three cultivars -- Bing Cherries, Envy Apples, and Jazz Apples -- and two tree architectures -- Upright Fruiting Offshoot and V-Trellis. Leveraging participant interviews and video data, this analysis uses grounded coding to extract pruning terminology, discover horticultural contexts that influence pruning decisions, and find implementable pruning heuristics for autonomous systems. The results include a validated terminology set, which we offer for use by both pruning stakeholders and roboticists, to communicate general pruning concepts and heuristics. The results also highlight seven pruning heuristics utilizing this terminology set that would be relevant for use by future autonomous robot pruning systems, and characterize three discovered horticultural contexts (i.e., environmental management, crop-load management, and replacement wood) across all three cultivars.Cosmic Piano: analysing the sound of the Universe. We present the Cosmic Piano, an innovative outreach tool designed to detect muons from air showers produced by cosmic rays colliding with the atmosphere. The Cosmic Piano consists of scintillator-based modules with avalanche photodiodes (APD) readout, which produce a musical note and a flash of light whenever a muon passes through one of them and triggers its electronics. The Cosmic Piano has been showcased at various high-profile events, including the Montreux Jazz Festival and the EuroScience Open Forum, seamlessly fusing scientific phenomena with live music. Building on its success, we have developed a new, comprehensive Masterclass session aimed at engaging high school and university students. This session includes analysing both simulated cosmic ray events and real data from the Cosmic Piano. The Masterclass provides participants with a hands-on experience that mirrors the experimental procedures used in major physics experiments, such as those conducted at CERN with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collision data. This initiative offers a unique opportunity for students to engage with an active experiment, bridging the gap between outreach and serious scientific research.Transformations of Triads and Seventh Chords: Group Extensions and   Duality. Transformational music theory, pioneered by David Lewin, uses simply transitive group actions to analyze music. In this paper, we construct a simply transitive group action on a disjoint union of two sets, built from a simply transitive action on each set and an equivariant bijection connecting them. Motivational examples are the omnibus progression and the reflected omnibus progression, which involve the consonant triads and the dominant/half-diminished seventh chords, connected by the inclusion bijection. We provide other examples from Jazz tunes. More generally, we combine multiple simply transitive group actions via a "meta-rotation"; examples include a simply transitive group acting on consonant triads and a variety of seventh chords, as well as a meta-rotation that realizes the root position seventh chord sequence of the flattening transformation (described by Clough-Douthett's J-function). The constructions in our theorems extend Lewin dual pairs to Lewin dual pairs. We formulate the constructions in terms of short exact sequences and central extensions as well. Contextual groups are also elucidated: the interval content of the generating pitch-class segment determines whether or not a generalized contextual group is generated by contextual inversions.Interactive Music and Synchronous Reactive Programming. This paper presents Skini, a programming methodology and an execution environment for interactive structured music. With this system, the composer programs his scores in the HipHop.js synchronous reactive language. They are then executed, or played, in live concerts, in interaction with the audience. The system aims at helping composers to find a good balance between the determinism of the compositions and the nondeterminism of the interactions with the public. Each execution of a Skini score yields to a different but aesthetically consistent interpretation. This work raises many questions in the musical fields. How to combine composition and interaction? How to control the musical style when the audience influences what is to play next? What are the possible connections with generative music? These are important questions for the Skini system but they are out of the scope of this paper that focuses exclusively on the computer science aspects of the system. From that perspective, the main questions are how to program the scores and in which language? General purpose languages are inappropriate because their elementary constructs (i.e., variables, functions, loops, etc.) do not match the constructions needed to express music and musical constraints. We show that synchronous programming languages are a much better fit because they rely on temporal constructs that can be directly used to represent musical scores and because their malleability enables composers to experiment easily with artistic variations of their initial scores. The paper mostly focuses on scores programming. It exposes the process a composer should follow from his very first musical intuitions up to the generation of a musical artifact. The paper presents some excerpts of the programming of a classical music composition that it then precisely relates to an actual recording. Examples of techno music and jazz are also presented, with audio artifact, to demonstrate the versatility of the system. Finally, brief presentations of past live concerts are presented as an evidence of viability of the system.
