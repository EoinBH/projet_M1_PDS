0,"Trevor Watkis - Routes (Bandcamp Friday Challenge). Decided to debut a new weekly feature here. Newer musicians need all the help they can get and purchases from Bandcamp stores can go a long way. The tune featured here is by pianist Trevor Watkins, who is one of the more talented jazz pianists from the UK. His stye is very reminiscent of Mulgrew Miller. Here he is paired with saxophonist Ralph Moore playing music inspired by underrated jazz trumpeter Dizzy Reece. If you purchased, Let others know and like and comment on bandcamp. The challenge is on!

8,"Thoughts regarding Miles Davis criticism of the Ellington-Mingus-Roach collaboration?. Like many other jazz fans, I love the album Money Jungle that they all did together, so I must say I was surprised to find how harsh Davis was about it.  In his own words:  “What am I supposed to say to that? That's ridiculous. You see the way they can ____ up music? It's a mismatch. They don't complement each other. Max and Mingus can play together, by themselves. Mingus is a hell of a bass player, and Max is a hell of a drummer. But Duke can't play with them, and they can't play with Duke. Now, how are you going to give a thing like that some stars? Record companies should be kicked in the ___. Somebody should take a picket sign and picket the record company.”  (This is from a 1964 Downbeat interview. Davis was doing the blindfold test and they played their version of Caravan to him.)  Personally I think they complemented each other in a great and very unique way, pushing each other into new directions.  So I’m intrigued to hear different perspectives on this.",Reddit
9,"A new and modern way to use the saxophone. I wanted to share an example of how my band Smag På Dig Selv is using the bass saxophone in a modern, high-energy context. The bass sax is right at the center of our sound, and it’s been a surprisingly strong way to get younger listeners interested in jazz without framing it as jazz.  We’ve literally been travelling around the world with this setup, playing festivals and big stages, and everywhere we go people go absolutely wild at our shows. On our newer and upcoming releases I’m playing bass sax throughout, pushing the instrument further into a contemporary electronic/techno/trance- influenced direction.

I consider myself a jazz enjoyer and in my teens I had lessons with a proper jazz guitarist who taught me standards and reading music and that kind of stuff. But it’s not what I listen to daily.  Mostly indie rock but I consider myself to be a fairly broad listener. The jazz I DO like and come back to quite frequently is all “greats” and “legends” from the 60s playing stuff that’s real cutting edge and avant-garde… in the 60s. I love Mingus, Coltrane, Coleman, Miles, Andrew Hill, and most of the other guys you’d expect a white rock fan to have experimented with when they were getting into jazz. But the reason I like that stuff is the avant garde appeal. I’d like to know where the avant garde is at in 2025 and I’m open to really out there suggestions even if I don’t like it too much.

So in the key of C for example, that's like playing the root note C over an E7 chord, which becomes E7's #5 sound.  I love this sound on this chord a lot because it creates such an interesting texture.  Which other early 1900s tunes (pre-swing, pre-bebop) do you know have this sound like the two mentioned above?  Edit: I meant the C note as the melody with the E7 chord underneath. So the overall sound, from bottom to top, is E, G#, B, D, C.

60,"Attitude of jazz musicians. I'm speaking as a SE Asian currently in Taiwan (East Asia). My first venture into music also wasn't jazz, but rock and funk.  Having said that, last night, my friends in my jazz ensemble class drank together. For every round, someone would ask a question and one by one we'd answer it. Then the question of, ""What do you dislike in a musician?"" came up. I mentioned that I don't like people with attitude problems since I've encountered a lot of those when I was still working with rock and funk musicians. Some would be overtly narcissistic (a bit of narcissism would be okay, but not too much), some would have inflated egos, some would be arrogant and would overestimate their skill level. And of course there are some who have problems with the opposite sex. Coincidentally, some of my buddies who also started with non-jazz genre echoed what I said, and we agreed that we encountered only few (some even said none) people with attitude problems in jazz.  Also, whenever I'd ask something in this sub, I'd notice that people would respond constructively, while some would even empathize with the hardships I had while learning jazz.  So I was thinking if my experience of knowing less people with attitude problems in jazz than in other genres is also similar to what others have experienced.  EDIT: Forgot to say that jazz also humbled me. While I received compliments for my bass playing in my funk band, I always think that in jazz, I'm shit, so I still continue self-studying, learning and transcribing other tunes, watching and observing jazz performances, going to open jams, etc. ",Reddit

100,"Improving Automatic Jazz Melody Generation by Transfer Learning Techniques. In this paper, we tackle the problem of transfer learning for Jazz automatic generation. Jazz is one of representative types of music, but the lack of Jazz data in the MIDI format hinders the construction of a generative model for Jazz. Transfer learning is an approach aiming to solve the problem of data insufficiency, so as to transfer the common feature from one domain to another. In view of its success in other machine learning problems, we investigate whether, and how much, it can help improve automatic music generation for under-resourced musical genres. Specifically, we use a recurrent variational autoencoder as the generative model, and use a genre-unspecified dataset as the source dataset and a Jazz-only dataset as the target dataset. Two transfer learning methods are evaluated using six levels of source-to-target data ratios. The first method is to train the model on the source dataset, and then fine-tune the resulting model parameters on the target dataset. The second method is to train the model on both the source and target datasets at the same time, but add genre labels to the latent vectors and use a genre classifier to improve Jazz generation. The evaluation results show that the second method seems to perform better overall, but it cannot take full advantage of the genre-unspecified dataset.",Arxiv

103,"Does it Swing? Microtiming Deviations and Swing Feeling in Jazz. Jazz music that swings has the fascinating power to elicit a pleasant sensation of flow in listeners and the desire to synchronize body movements with the music. Whether microtiming deviations (MTDs), i.e. small timing deviations below the bar or phrase level, enhance the feeling of swing is highly debated in the current literature. Studies on other groove related genres did not find evidence for a positive impact of MTDs. The present study addresses jazz music and swing in particular, as there is some evidence that microtiming patterns are genre-specific. We recorded twelve piano jazz standards played by a professional pianist and manipulated the natural MTDs of the recordings in systematic ways by quantizing, expanding and inverting them. MTDs were defined with respect to a grid determined by the average swing ratio. The original and manipulated versions were presented in an online survey and evaluated by 160 listeners with various musical skill levels and backgrounds. Across pieces the quantized versions (without MTDs) were rated slightly higher and versions with expanded MTDs were rated lower with regard to swing than the original recordings. Unexpectedly, inversion had no impact on swing ratings except for two pieces. Our results suggest that naturally fluctuating MTDs are not an essential factor for the feeling of swing.",Arxiv

105,"Comparative Assessment of Markov Models and Recurrent Neural Networks for Jazz Music Generation. As generative models have risen in popularity, a domain that has risen alongside is generative models for music. Our study aims to compare the performance of a simple Markov chain model and a recurrent neural network (RNN) model, two popular models for sequence generating tasks, in jazz music improvisation. While music, especially jazz, remains subjective in telling whether a composition is ""good"" or ""bad"", we aim to quantify our results using metrics of groove pattern similarity and pitch class histogram entropy. We trained both models using transcriptions of jazz blues choruses from professional jazz players, and also fed musical jazz seeds to help give our model some context in beginning the generation. Our results show that the RNN outperforms the Markov model on both of our metrics, indicating better rhythmic consistency and tonal stability in the generated music. Through the use of music21 library, we tokenized our jazz dataset into pitches and durations that our model could interpret and train on. Our findings contribute to the growing field of AI-generated music, highlighting the important use of metrics to assess generation quality. Future work includes expanding the dataset of MIDI files to a larger scale, conducting human surveys for subjective evaluations, and incorporating additional metrics to address the challenge of subjectivity in music evaluation. Our study provides valuable insight into the use of recurrent neural networks for sequential based tasks like generating music.",Arxiv
106,"Correlated microtiming deviations in jazz and rock music. Musical rhythms performed by humans typically show temporal fluctuations. While they have been characterized in simple rhythmic tasks, it is an open question what is the nature of temporal fluctuations, when several musicians perform music jointly in all its natural complexity. To study such fluctuations in over 100 original jazz and rock/pop recordings played with and without metronome we developed a semi-automated workflow allowing the extraction of cymbal beat onsets with millisecond precision. Analyzing the inter-beat interval (IBI) time series revealed evidence for two long-range correlated processes characterized by power laws in the IBI power spectral densities. One process dominates on short timescales ($t < 8$ beats) and reflects microtiming variability in the generation of single beats. The other dominates on longer timescales and reflects slow tempo variations. Whereas the latter did not show differences between musical genres (jazz vs. rock/pop), the process on short timescales showed higher variability for jazz recordings, indicating that jazz makes stronger use of microtiming fluctuations within a measure than rock/pop. Our results elucidate principles of rhythmic performance and can inspire algorithms for artificial music generation. By studying microtiming fluctuations in original music recordings, we bridge the gap between minimalistic tapping paradigms and expressive rhythmic performances.",Arxiv

This paper presents the Jazz Transformer, a generative model that utilizes a neural sequence model called the Transformer-XL for modeling lead sheets of Jazz music.

While we are able to reduce the training loss to a low value, our listening test suggests however a clear gap between the average ratings of the generated and real compositions. We therefore go one step further and conduct a series of computational analysis of the generated compositions from different perspectives. This includes analyzing the statistics of the pitch class, grooving, and chord progression, assessing the structureness of the music with the help of the fitness scape plot, and evaluating the model's understanding of Jazz music through a MIREX-like continuation prediction task.

Using data on the entire history of recorded jazz from 1896 to 2010, I show that observed collaborations have tolerated the openness of high weight triads more than expected, observed jazz sessions had more forbidden triads than expected, and the density of forbidden triads contributed to the success of recording sessions, measured by the number of record releases of session material. The article also shows that the sessions of Miles Davis had received an especially high boost from forbidden triads.",Arxiv
109,"Reinforcement Learning Jazz Improvisation: When Music Meets Game Theory. Live performances of music are always charming, with the unpredictability of improvisation due to the dynamic between musicians and interactions with the audience. Jazz improvisation is a particularly noteworthy example for further investigation from a theoretical perspective. Here, we introduce a novel mathematical game theory model for jazz improvisation, providing a framework for studying music theory and improvisational methodologies. We use computational modeling, mainly reinforcement learning, to explore diverse stochastic improvisational strategies and their paired performance on improvisation. We find that the most effective strategy pair is a strategy that reacts to the most recent payoff (Stepwise Changes) with a reinforcement learning strategy limited to notes in the given chord (Chord-Following Reinforcement Learning). Conversely, a strategy that reacts to the partner's last note and attempts to harmonize with it (Harmony Prediction) strategy pair yields the lowest non-control payoff and highest standard deviation, indicating that picking notes based on immediate reactions to the partner player can yield inconsistent outcomes. On average, the Chord-Following Reinforcement Learning strategy demonstrates the highest mean payoff, while Harmony Prediction exhibits the lowest. Our work lays the foundation for promising applications beyond jazz: including the use of artificial intelligence (AI) models to extract data from audio clips to refine musical reward systems, and training machine learning (ML) models on existing jazz solos to further refine strategies within the game.",Arxiv

111,"Lisp, Jazz, Aikido -- Three Expressions of a Single Essence. The relation between Science (what we can explain) and Art (what we can't) has long been acknowledged and while every science contains an artistic part, every art form also needs a bit of science. Among all scientific disciplines, programming holds a special place for two reasons. First, the artistic part is not only undeniable but also essential. Second, and much like in a purely artistic discipline, the act of programming is driven partly by the notion of aesthetics: the pleasure we have in creating beautiful things. Even though the importance of aesthetics in the act of programming is now unquestioned, more could still be written on the subject. The field called ""psychology of programming"" focuses on the cognitive aspects of the activity, with the goal of improving the productivity of programmers. While many scientists have emphasized their concern for aesthetics and the impact it has on their activity, few computer scientists have actually written about their thought process while programming. What makes us like or dislike such and such language or paradigm? Why do we shape our programs the way we do? By answering these questions from the angle of aesthetics, we may be able to shed some new light on the art of programming. Starting from the assumption that aesthetics is an inherently transversal dimension, it should be possible for every programmer to find the same aesthetic driving force in every creative activity they undertake, not just programming, and in doing so, get deeper insight on why and how they do things the way they do. On the other hand, because our aesthetic sensitivities are so personal, all we can really do is relate our own experiences and share it with others, in the hope that it will inspire them to do the same. My personal life has been revolving around three major creative activities, of equal importance: programming in Lisp, playing Jazz music, and practicing Aikido. But why so many of them, why so different ones, and why these specifically? By introspecting my personal aesthetic sensitivities, I eventually realized that my tastes in the scientific, artistic, and physical domains are all motivated by the same driving forces, hence unifying Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido as three expressions of a single essence, not so different after all. Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido are governed by a limited set of rules which remain simple and unobtrusive. Conforming to them is a pleasure. Because Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido are inherently introspective disciplines, they also invite you to transgress the rules in order to find your own. Breaking the rules is fun. Finally, if Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido unify so many paradigms, styles, or techniques, it is not by mere accumulation but because they live at the meta-level and let you reinvent them. Working at the meta-level is an enlightening experience. Understand your aesthetic sensitivities and you may gain considerable insight on your own psychology of programming. Mine is perhaps common to most lispers. Perhaps also common to other programming communities, but that, is for the reader to decide...",Arxiv
112,"Differences in Jazz Project Leaders' Competencies and Behaviors: A Preliminary Empirical Investigation. Studying the human factors that impact on software development, and assigning individuals with specific competencies and qualities to particular software roles, have been shown to aid software project performance. For instance, prior evidence suggests that extroverted software project leaders are most successful. Role assignment based on individuals' competencies and behaviors may be especially relevant in distributed software development contexts where teams are often affected by distance, cultural, and personality issues. Project leaders in these environments need to possess high levels of inter-personal, intra-personal and organizational competencies if they are to appropriately manage such issues and maintain positive project performance. With a view to understanding and explaining the specific competencies and behaviors that are required of project leaders in these settings, we used psycholinguistic and directed content analysis to study the way six successful IBM Rational Jazz leaders operated while coordinating their three distributed projects. Contrary to previous evidence reported in personality studies, our results did not reveal universal competencies and behaviors among these Jazz leaders. Instead, Jazz project leaders' competencies and behaviors varied with their project portfolio of tasks. Our findings suggest that a pragmatic approach that considers the nature of the software tasks being developed is likely to be a more effective strategy for assigning leaders to distributed software teams, as against a strategy that promotes a specific personality type. We discuss these findings and outline implications for distributed software project governance.",Arxiv

The process applies principles from music theory to reduce the dimensionality of chord space, determine a common key signature representation, and compute a chordal co-occurrence matrix. The rows of the matrix form a basis for the vector space in which chord progressions are represented as piecewise linear functions, and harmonic similarity is evaluated by computing the membrane area, a novel distance metric. To illustrate our method's effectiveness, we apply it to the Impro-Visor corpus of 2,612 chord progressions, and present examples demonstrating its ability to account for reharmonizations and find contrafacts.",Arxiv
116,"What can developers' messages tell us? A psycholinguistic analysis of Jazz teams' attitudes and behavior patterns. Reports that communication and behavioral issues contribute to inadequately performing software teams have fuelled a wealth of research aimed at understanding the human processes employed during software development. The increasing level of interest in human issues is particularly relevant for agile and global software development approaches that emphasize the importance of people and their interactions during projects. While mature analysis techniques in behavioral psychology have been recommended for studying such issues, particularly when using archives and artifacts, these techniques have rarely been used in software engineering research. We utilize these techniques under an embedded case study approach to examine whether IBM Rational Jazz practitioners' behaviors change over project duration and whether certain tasks affect teams' attitudes and behaviors. We found highest levels of project engagement at project start and completion, as well as increasing levels of team collectiveness as projects progressed. Additionally, Jazz practitioners were most insightful and perceptive at the time of project scoping. Further, Jazz teams' attitudes and behaviors varied in line with the nature of the tasks they were performing. We explain these findings and discuss their implications for software project governance and tool design.",Arxiv
117,"Decision-Based Transcription of Jazz Guitar Solos Using a Harmonic Bident Analysis Filter Bank and Spectral Distribution Weighting. Jazz guitar solos are improvised melody lines played on one instrument on top of a chordal accompaniment (comping). As the improvisation happens spontaneously, a reference score is non-existent, only a lead sheet. There are situations, however, when one would like to have the original melody lines in the form of notated music, see the Real Book. The motivation is either for the purpose of practice and imitation or for musical analysis. In this work, an automatic transcriber for jazz guitar solos is developed. It resorts to a very intuitive representation of tonal music signals: the pitchgram. No instrument-specific modeling is involved, so the transcriber should be applicable to other pitched instruments as well. Neither is there the need to learn any note profiles prior to or during the transcription. Essentially, the proposed transcriber is a decision tree, thus a classifier, with a depth of 3. It has a (very) low computational complexity and can be run on-line. The decision rules can be refined or extended with no or little musical education. The transcriber's performance is evaluated on a set of ten jazz solo excerpts and compared with a state-of-the-art transcription system for the guitar plus PYIN. We achieve an improvement of 34% w.r.t. the reference system and 19% w.r.t. PYIN in terms of the F-measure. Another measure of accuracy, the error score, attests that the number of erroneous pitch detections is reduced by more than 50% w.r.t. the reference system and by 45% w.r.t. PYIN.",Arxiv
118,"Deconstructing Jazz Piano Style Using Machine Learning. Artistic style has been studied for centuries, and recent advances in machine learning create new possibilities for understanding it computationally. However, ensuring that machine-learning models produce insights aligned with the interests of practitioners and critics remains a significant challenge. Here, we focus on musical style, which benefits from a rich theoretical and mathematical analysis tradition. We train a variety of supervised-learning models to identify 20 iconic jazz musicians across a carefully curated dataset of 84 hours of recordings, and interpret their decision-making processes. Our models include a novel multi-input architecture that enables four musical domains (melody, harmony, rhythm, and dynamics) to be analysed separately. These models enable us to address fundamental questions in music theory and also advance the state-of-the-art in music performer identification (94% accuracy across 20 classes). We release open-source implementations of our models and an accompanying web application for exploring musical styles.",Arxiv
119,"The True Role of Active Communicators: An Empirical Study of Jazz Core Developers. Context: Interest in software engineering (SE) methodologies and tools has been complemented in recent years by research efforts oriented towards understanding the human processes involved in software development. This shift has been imperative given reports of inadequately performing teams and the consequent growing emphasis on individuals and team relations in contemporary SE methods. Objective: While software repositories have frequently been studied with a view to explaining such human processes, research has tended to use primarily quantitative analysis approaches. There is concern, however, that such approaches can provide only a partial picture of the software process. Given the way human behavior is nuanced within psychological and social contexts, it has been asserted that a full understanding may only be achieved through deeper contextual enquiries. Method: We have followed such an approach and have applied data mining, SNA, psycholinguistic analysis and directed content analysis (CA) to study the way core developers at IBM Rational Jazz contribute their social and intellectual capital, and have compared the attitudes, interactions and activities of these members to those of their less active counterparts. Results: Among our results, we uncovered that Jazz's core developers worked across multiple roles, and were crucial to their teams' organizational, intra-personal and inter-personal processes. Additionally, although these individuals were highly task- and achievement-focused, they were also largely responsible for maintaining positive team atmosphere, and for providing context awareness in support of their colleagues. Conclusion: Our results suggest that high-performing distributed agile teams rely on both individual and collective efforts, as well as organizational environments that promote informal and organic work structures.(Abridged)",Arxiv
120,"What Affects Team Behavior? Preliminary Linguistic Analysis of Communications in the Jazz Repository. There is a growing belief that understanding and addressing the human processes employed during software development is likely to provide substantially more value to industry than yet more recommendations for the implementation of various methods and tools. To this end, considerable research effort has been dedicated to studying human issues as represented in software artifacts, due to its relatively unobtrusive nature. We have followed this line of research and have conducted a preliminary study of team behaviors using data mining techniques and linguistic analysis. Our data source, the IBM Rational Jazz repository, was mined and data from three different project areas were extracted. Communications in these projects were then analyzed using the LIWC linguistic analysis tool. We found that although there are some variations in language use among teams working on project areas dedicated to different software outcomes, project type and the mix of (and number of) individuals involved did not affect team behaviors as evident in their communications. These assessments are initial conjectures, however; we plan further exploratory analysis to validate these results. We explain these findings and discuss their implications for software engineering practice.",Arxiv
121,"Bootstrapping Mirror Pairs: The Beginning of the End. Three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges possess a unique duality known as 3d mirror symmetry. Under this correspondence, the Coulomb branch of one theory is equivalent to the Higgs branch of its mirror dual, and vice versa. Over the past decades, extensive effort has been devoted to charting the landscape of 3d mirror pairs, though progress has often been constrained by the need to identify suitable brane configurations. In this first instalment, we introduce a new quiver-based algorithm, termed Growth and Fusion, which completes a quartet of Higgsing algorithms alongside Decay and Fission, Quiver Subtraction, and Quiver Addition. Together, these four algorithms provide a systematic framework that circumvents the limitations of brane constructions, enabling us to determine the mirror dual of a given quiver and to systematically bootstrap new 3d mirror pairs. We demonstrate the power of this approach on a new class of circular 3d mirror pairs.",Arxiv
122,"Exploring the links between software development task type, team attitudes and task completion performance: Insights from the Jazz repository. Context: In seeking to better understand the impact of various human factors in software development, and how teams' attitudes relate to their performance, increasing attention is being given to the study of team-related artefacts. In particular, researchers have conducted numerous studies on a range of team communication channels to explore links between developers' language use and the incidence of software bugs in the products they delivered. Comparatively limited attention has been paid, however, to the full range of software tasks that are commonly performed during the development and delivery of software systems, in spite of compelling evidence pointing to the need to understand teams' attitudes more widely. Objective: We were therefore motivated to study the relationships between task type and team attitudes, and how attitudes expressed in teams' communications might be related to their task completion performance when undertaking a range of activities. Method: Our investigation involved artefacts from 474 IBM Jazz practitioners assembled in 149 teams working on around 30,000 software development tasks over a three-year period. We applied linguistic analysis, standard statistical techniques and directed content analysis to address our research objective. Results: Our evidence revealed that teams expressed different attitudes when working on various forms of software tasks, and they were particularly emotional when working to remedy defects. That said, teams' expression of attitudes was not found to be a strong predictor of their task completion performance. Conclusion: Efforts aimed at reducing bug incidence may positively limit teams' emotional disposition when resolving bugs, thereby reducing the otherwise high demand for emotionally stable members.

With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), this threat is likely to intensify, potentially overwhelming human defenders. To achieve the necessary scale and tempo to defend against these threats, utilizing AI as part of the solution seems inevitable. Although there has been a significant debate on AI in Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS), it is equally likely that AI will be widely used in information operations for defensive and offensive objectives. Similar to LAWS, AI-driven information operations occupy a highly sensitive moral domain where removing human involvement in the tactical decision making process raises ethical concerns. Although AI has yet to revolutionize the field, a solid ethical stance is urgently needed on how AI can be responsibly used to defend against information operations on social media platforms. This paper proposes possible AI-enabled countermeasures against cognitive warfare and argues how they can be developed in a responsible way, such that meaningful human control is preserved.",Arxiv

We train and use music genre classifier to assess the performance of the transfer models. To that end, we obtain 87.7% accuracy with Multi-layer Perceptron algorithm. To improve our style transfer baseline, we add auxiliary discriminators and triplet loss to our model. According to our experiments, we obtain the best accuracies as 69.4% in Jazz to Classic task and 39.3% in Classic to Jazz task with our developed genre classifier.

126,"Reconstructing the Charlie Parker Omnibook using an audio-to-score automatic transcription pipeline. The Charlie Parker Omnibook is a cornerstone of jazz music education, described by pianist Ethan Iverson as ""the most important jazz education text ever published"". In this work we propose a new transcription pipeline and explore the extent to which state of the art music technology is able to reconstruct these scores directly from the audio without human intervention. Our pipeline includes: a newly trained source separation model for saxophone, a new MIDI transcription model for solo saxophone and an adaptation of an existing MIDI-to-score method for monophonic instruments.   To assess this pipeline we also provide an enhanced dataset of Charlie Parker transcriptions as score-audio pairs with accurate MIDI alignments and downbeat annotations. This represents a challenging new benchmark for automatic audio-to-score transcription that we hope will advance research into areas beyond transcribing audio-to-MIDI alone.   Together, these form another step towards producing scores that musicians can use directly, without the need for onerous corrections or revisions. To facilitate future research, all model checkpoints and data are made available to download along with code for the transcription pipeline. Improvements in our modular pipeline could one day make the automatic transcription of complex jazz solos a routine possibility, thereby enriching the resources available for music education and preservation.",Arxiv

As a training corpus, we had a professional pianist play about 150 melodies of jazz, pop, and latin jazz. The results show a good predictive power, validating the choice of our model. Additionally, we set up a listening test whose results reveal that on average, people significantly prefer the melodies generated by the MaxEnt model than the ones without any expression, or with fully random expression. Furthermore, in some cases, MaxEnt melodies are almost as popular as the human performed ones.",Arxiv
128,"Computational approach to multifractal music. In this work we perform a fractal analysis of 160 pieces of music belonging to six different genres. We show that the majority of the pieces reveal characteristics that allow us to classify them as physical processes called the 1/f (pink) noise. However, this is not true for classical music represented here by Frederic Chopin's works and for some jazz pieces that are much more correlated than the pink noise. We also perform a multifractal (MFDFA) analysis of these music pieces. We show that all the pieces reveal multifractal properties. The richest multifractal structures are observed for pop and rock music. Also the viariably of multifractal features is best visible for popular music genres. This can suggest that, from the multifractal perspective, classical and jazz music is much more uniform than pieces of the most popular genres of music.",Arxiv

130,"How do Globally Distributed Agile Teams Self-organise? Initial Insights from a Case Study. Agile software developers are required to self-organize, occupying various informal roles as needed in order to successfully deliver software features. However, previous research has reported conflicting evidence about the way teams actually undertake this activity. The ability to self-organize is particularly necessary for software development in globally distributed environments, where distance has been shown to exacerbate human-centric issues. Understanding the way successful teams self-organise should inform distributed team composition strategies and software project governance. We have used psycholinguistics to study the way IBM Rational Jazz practitioners enacted various roles, expressed attitudes and shared competencies to successfully self-organize in their global projects. Among our findings, we uncovered that practitioners enacted various roles depending on their teams' cohort of features; and that team leaders were most critical to IBM Jazz teams' self-organisation.

134,"Shaping the Epochal Individuality and Generality: The Temporal Dynamics of Uncertainty and Prediction Error in Musical Improvisation. Musical improvisation, much like spontaneous speech, reveals intricate facets of the improviser's state of mind and emotional character. However, the specific musical components that reveal such individuality remain largely unexplored. Within the framework of brain's statistical learning and predictive processing, this study examined the temporal dynamics of uncertainty and surprise (prediction error) in a piece of musical improvisation. This study employed the HBSL model to analyze a corpus of 456 Jazz improvisations, spanning 1905 to 2009, from 78 distinct Jazz musicians. The results indicated distinctive temporal patterns of surprise and uncertainty, especially in pitch and pitch-rhythm sequences, revealing era-specific features from the early 20th to the 21st centuries. Conversely, rhythm sequences exhibited a consistent degree of uncertainty across eras. Further, the acoustic properties remain unchanged across different periods. These findings highlight the importance of how temporal dynamics of surprise and uncertainty in improvisational music change over periods, profoundly influencing the distinctive methodologies artists adopt for improvisation in each era. Further, it is suggested that the development of improvisational music can be attributed to the brain's adaptive statistical learning mechanisms, which constantly refine internal models to mirror the cultural and emotional nuances of their respective epochs. This study unravels the evolutionary trajectory of improvisational music and highlights the nuanced shifts artists employ to resonate with the cultural and emotional landscapes of their times.",Arxiv
135,"Contextual Linear Types for Differential Privacy. Language support for differentially-private programming is both crucial and delicate. While elaborate program logics can be very expressive, type-system based approaches using linear types tend to be more lightweight and amenable to automatic checking and inference, and in particular in the presence of higher-order programming. Since the seminal design of Fuzz, which is restricted to $ε$-differential privacy in its original design, significant progress has been made to support more advancedvariants of differential privacy, like($ε$,$δ$)-differential privacy. However, supporting these advanced privacy variants while also supporting higher-order programming in full has proven to be challenging. We present Jazz, a language and type system which uses linear types and latent contextual effects to support both advanced variants of differential privacy and higher-order programming. Latent contextual effects allow delaying the payment of effects for connectives such as products, sums and functions, yielding advantages in terms of precision of the analysis and annotation burden upon elimination, as well as modularity. We formalize the core of Jazz, prove it sound for privacy via a logical relation for metric preservation, and illustrate its expressive power through a number of case studies drawn from the recent differential privacy literature.",Arxiv

141,"ImprovNet -- Generating Controllable Musical Improvisations with Iterative Corruption Refinement. Despite deep learning's remarkable advances in style transfer across various domains, generating controllable performance-level musical style transfer for complete symbolically represented musical works remains a challenging area of research. Much of this is owed to limited datasets, especially for genres such as jazz, and the lack of unified models that can handle multiple music generation tasks. This paper presents ImprovNet, a transformer-based architecture that generates expressive and controllable musical improvisations through a self-supervised corruption-refinement training strategy. The improvisational style transfer is aimed at making meaningful modifications to one or more musical elements - melody, harmony or rhythm of the original composition with respect to the target genre. ImprovNet unifies multiple capabilities within a single model: it can perform cross-genre and intra-genre improvisations, harmonize melodies with genre-specific styles, and execute short prompt continuation and infilling tasks. The model's iterative generation framework allows users to control the degree of style transfer and structural similarity to the original composition. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate ImprovNet's effectiveness in generating musically coherent improvisations while maintaining structural relationships with the original pieces. The model outperforms Anticipatory Music Transformer in short continuation and infilling tasks and successfully achieves recognizable genre conversion, with 79\% of participants correctly identifying jazz-style improvisations of classical pieces.

Then, a classifier filters the graph of all possible dependency arcs to produce the dependency tree. One major benefit of this system is that it can be easily integrated into modern deep-learning pipelines. Moreover, since it does not rely on any particular symbolic grammar, it can consider multiple musical features simultaneously, make use of sequential context information, and produce partial results for noisy inputs. We test our approach on two datasets of musical trees -- time-span trees of monophonic note sequences and harmonic trees of jazz chord sequences -- and show that our approach outperforms previous methods.",Arxiv

Additionally, our limited human trials suggest potential directions for future research.",Arxiv
154,"You Are What You Eat... Listen to, Watch, and Read. This article describes a data driven method for deriving the relationship between personality and media preferences. A qunatifiable representation of such a relationship can be leveraged for use in recommendation systems and ameliorate the ""cold start"" problem. Here, the data is comprised of an original collection of 1,316 Okcupid dating profiles. Of these profiles, 800 are labeled with one of 16 possible Myers-Briggs Type Indicators (MBTI). A personality specific topic model describing a person's favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food was generated using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). There were several significant findings, for example, intuitive thinking types preferred sci-fi/fantasy entertainment, extraversion correlated positively with upbeat dance music, and jazz, folk, and international cuisine correlated positively with those characterized by openness to experience. Many other correlations confirmed previous findings describing the relationship among personality, writing style, and personal preferences.

155,"Scorpiano -- A System for Automatic Music Transcription for Monophonic Piano Music. Music transcription is the process of transcribing music audio into music notation. It is a field in which the machines still cannot beat human performance. The main motivation for automatic music transcription is to make it possible for anyone playing a musical instrument, to be able to generate the music notes for a piece of music quickly and accurately. It does not matter if the person is a beginner and simply struggles to find the music score by searching, or an expert who heard a live jazz improvisation and would like to reproduce it without losing time doing manual transcription. We propose Scorpiano -- a system that can automatically generate a music score for simple monophonic piano melody tracks using digital signal processing. The system integrates multiple digital audio processing methods: notes onset detection, tempo estimation, beat detection, pitch detection and finally generation of the music score. The system has proven to give good results for simple piano melodies, comparable to commercially available neural network based systems.",Arxiv
156,"Different amplitude and time distribution of the sound of light and classical music. Several pieces of different musical kinds were studied measuring $N(A)$, the output amplitude of a peak detector driven by the electric signal arriving to the loudspeaker. Fixed a suitable threshold $\bar{A}$, we considered $N(A)$, the number of times that $A(t)>\bar{A}$, each of them we named event and $N(t)$, the distribution of times $t$ between two consecutive events. Some $N(A)$ and $N(t)$ distributions are displayed in the reported logarithmic plots, showing that jazz, pop, rock and other popular rhythms have noise-distribution, while classical pieces of music are characterized by more complex statistics. We pointed out the extraordinary case of the aria ``\textit{La calunnia è un venticello}'', where the words describe an avalanche or seismic process, calumny, and the rossinian music shows $N(A)$ and $N(t)$ distribution typical of earthquakes.",Arxiv
157,"JaCappella Corpus: A Japanese a Cappella Vocal Ensemble Corpus. We construct a corpus of Japanese a cappella vocal ensembles (jaCappella corpus) for vocal ensemble separation and synthesis. It consists of 35 copyright-cleared vocal ensemble songs and their audio recordings of individual voice parts. These songs were arranged from out-of-copyright Japanese children's songs and have six voice parts (lead vocal, soprano, alto, tenor, bass, and vocal percussion). They are divided into seven subsets, each of which features typical characteristics of a music genre such as jazz and enka. The variety in genre and voice part match vocal ensembles recently widespread in social media services such as YouTube, although the main targets of conventional vocal ensemble datasets are choral singing made up of soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our corpus is a challenging resource for vocal ensemble separation. Our corpus is available on our project page (https://tomohikonakamura.github.io/jaCappella_corpus/).",Arxiv
158,"Audio Processing using Pattern Recognition for Music Genre Classification. This project explores the application of machine learning techniques for music genre classification using the GTZAN dataset, which contains 100 audio files per genre. Motivated by the growing demand for personalized music recommendations, we focused on classifying five genres-Blues, Classical, Jazz, Hip Hop, and Country-using a variety of algorithms including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) implemented via Keras. The ANN model demonstrated the best performance, achieving a validation accuracy of 92.44%. We also analyzed key audio features such as spectral roll-off, spectral centroid, and MFCCs, which helped enhance the model's accuracy. Future work will expand the model to cover all ten genres, investigate advanced methods like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and ensemble approaches, and develop a web application for real-time genre classification and playlist generation.

160,"Robot Drummer: Learning Rhythmic Skills for Humanoid Drumming. Humanoid robots have seen remarkable advances in dexterity, balance, and locomotion, yet their role in expressive domains such as music performance remains largely unexplored. Musical tasks, like drumming, present unique challenges, including split-second timing, rapid contacts, and multi-limb coordination over performances lasting minutes. In this paper, we introduce Robot Drummer, a humanoid capable of expressive, high-precision drumming across a diverse repertoire of songs. We formulate humanoid drumming as sequential fulfillment of timed contacts and transform drum scores into a Rhythmic Contact Chain. To handle the long-horizon nature of musical performance, we decompose each piece into fixed-length segments and train a single policy across all segments in parallel using reinforcement learning. Through extensive experiments on over thirty popular rock, metal, and jazz tracks, our results demonstrate that Robot Drummer consistently achieves high F1 scores. The learned behaviors exhibit emergent human-like drumming strategies, such as cross-arm strikes, and adaptive stick assignments, demonstrating the potential of reinforcement learning to bring humanoid robots into the domain of creative musical performance.

161,"Transformations of Triads and Seventh Chords: Group Extensions and Duality. Transformational music theory, pioneered by David Lewin, uses simply transitive group actions to analyze music. In this paper, we construct a simply transitive group action on a disjoint union of two sets, built from a simply transitive action on each set and an equivariant bijection connecting them. Motivational examples are the omnibus progression and the reflected omnibus progression, which involve the consonant triads and the dominant/half-diminished seventh chords, connected by the inclusion bijection. We provide other examples from Jazz tunes. More generally, we combine multiple simply transitive group actions via a ""meta-rotation""; examples include a simply transitive group acting on consonant triads and a variety of seventh chords, as well as a meta-rotation that realizes the root position seventh chord sequence of the flattening transformation (described by Clough-Douthett's J-function). The constructions in our theorems extend Lewin dual pairs to Lewin dual pairs. We formulate the constructions in terms of short exact sequences and central extensions as well. Contextual groups are also elucidated: the interval content of the generating pitch-class segment determines whether or not a generalized contextual group is generated by contextual inversions.",Arxiv
162,"Evaluating language models of tonal harmony. This study borrows and extends probabilistic language models from natural language processing to discover the syntactic properties of tonal harmony. Language models come in many shapes and sizes, but their central purpose is always the same: to predict the next event in a sequence of letters, words, notes, or chords. However, few studies employing such models have evaluated the most state-of-the-art architectures using a large-scale corpus of Western tonal music, instead preferring to use relatively small datasets containing chord annotations from contemporary genres like jazz, pop, and rock.   Using symbolic representations of prominent instrumental genres from the common-practice period, this study applies a flexible, data-driven encoding scheme to (1) evaluate Finite Context (or n-gram) models and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in a chord prediction task; (2) compare predictive accuracy from the best-performing models for chord onsets from each of the selected datasets; and (3) explain differences between the two model architectures in a regression analysis. We find that Finite Context models using the Prediction by Partial Match (PPM) algorithm outperform RNNs, particularly for the piano datasets, with the regression model suggesting that RNNs struggle with particularly rare chord types.",Arxiv
163,"Binaural recording methods with analysis on inter-aural time, level, and phase differences. Binaural recordings are a form of stereophonic recording method that replicates how human ears perceive sound, these types of recordings create a 3D aural image around the listener and are extremely immersive when well recorded and listened to appropriately with headphones. It has wide applications in video, podcast, and gaming formats -- allowing the listener to feel like they are there. Although binaural formats are seldom used for music applications, they have also been utilized in music ranging from Rock, Jazz, Acoustic, and Classical. In this paper, we will investigate the acoustical phenomenon that produces the binaural effect in audio recordings -- including the ITD (Inter-aural time difference), the ILD (inter-aural level difference), IPD (inter-aural phase difference) as well as the monaural spectral difference that occurs between two ears so we can better understand the replication of human hearing in binaural recordings. Binaural recordings differ from regular stereophonic recordings as they are arranged in a specific way to account for HRTF (Head-related transfer function). The most common method of binaural recordings is with two high-quality omni-directional microphones affixed on a dummy head where the ears are located, although other methods exist without the use of a full dummy head.",Arxiv
164,"Mining Hidden Populations through Attributed Search. Researchers often query online social platforms through their application programming interfaces (API) to find target populations such as people with mental illness~\cite{De-Choudhury2017} and jazz musicians~\cite{heckathorn2001finding}. Entities of such target population satisfy a property that is typically identified using an oracle (human or a pre-trained classifier). When the property of the target entities is not directly queryable via the API, we refer to the property as `hidden' and the population as a hidden population. Finding individuals who belong to these populations on social networks is hard because they are non-queryable, and the sampler has to explore from a combinatorial query space within a finite budget limit. By exploiting the correlation between queryable attributes and the population of interest and by hierarchically ordering the query space, we propose a Decision tree-based Thompson sampler (\texttt{DT-TMP}) that efficiently discovers the right combination of attributes to query. Our proposed sampler outperforms the state-of-the-art samplers in online experiments, for example by 54\% on Twitter. When the number of matching entities to a query is known in offline experiments, \texttt{DT-TMP} performs exceedingly well by a factor of 0.9-1.5$\times$ over the baseline samplers. In the future, we wish to explore the option of finding hidden populations by formulating more complex queries.",Arxiv
165,"Cosmic Piano: analysing the sound of the Universe. We present the Cosmic Piano, an innovative outreach tool designed to detect muons from air showers produced by cosmic rays colliding with the atmosphere. The Cosmic Piano consists of scintillator-based modules with avalanche photodiodes (APD) readout, which produce a musical note and a flash of light whenever a muon passes through one of them and triggers its electronics. The Cosmic Piano has been showcased at various high-profile events, including the Montreux Jazz Festival and the EuroScience Open Forum, seamlessly fusing scientific phenomena with live music. Building on its success, we have developed a new, comprehensive Masterclass session aimed at engaging high school and university students. This session includes analysing both simulated cosmic ray events and real data from the Cosmic Piano. The Masterclass provides participants with a hands-on experience that mirrors the experimental procedures used in major physics experiments, such as those conducted at CERN with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collision data.

166,"Multi-Step Chord Sequence Prediction Based on Aggregated Multi-Scale Encoder-Decoder Network. This paper studies the prediction of chord progressions for jazz music by relying on machine learning models. The motivation of our study comes from the recent success of neural networks for performing automatic music composition. Although high accuracies are obtained in single-step prediction scenarios, most models fail to generate accurate multi-step chord predictions. In this paper, we postulate that this comes from the multi-scale structure of musical information and propose new architectures based on an iterative temporal aggregation of input labels. Specifically, the input and ground truth labels are merged into increasingly large temporal bags, on which we train a family of encoder-decoder networks for each temporal scale. In a second step, we use these pre-trained encoder bottleneck features at each scale in order to train a final encoder-decoder network. Furthermore, we rely on different reductions of the initial chord alphabet into three adapted chord alphabets. We perform evaluations against several state-of-the-art models and show that our multi-scale architecture outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and perplexity, while requiring relatively few parameters. We analyze musical properties of the results, showing the influence of downbeat position within the analysis window on accuracy, and evaluate errors using a musically-informed distance metric.",Arxiv
167,"Catch-A-Waveform: Learning to Generate Audio from a Single Short Example. Models for audio generation are typically trained on hours of recordings. Here, we illustrate that capturing the essence of an audio source is typically possible from as little as a few tens of seconds from a single training signal. Specifically, we present a GAN-based generative model that can be trained on one short audio signal from any domain (e.g. speech, music, etc.) and does not require pre-training or any other form of external supervision. Once trained, our model can generate random samples of arbitrary duration that maintain semantic similarity to the training waveform, yet exhibit new compositions of its audio primitives. This enables a long line of interesting applications, including generating new jazz improvisations or new a-cappella rap variants based on a single short example, producing coherent modifications to famous songs (e.g. adding a new verse to a Beatles song based solely on the original recording), filling-in of missing parts (inpainting), extending the bandwidth of a speech signal (super-resolution), and enhancing old recordings without access to any clean training example. We show that in all cases, no more than 20 seconds of training audio commonly suffice for our model to achieve state-of-the-art results. This is despite its complete lack of prior knowledge about the nature of audio signals in general.",Arxiv
168,"Personality Profiles of Global Software Developers. Context: Individuals' personality traits have been shown to influence their behavior during team work. In particular, positive group attitudes are said to be essential for distributed and global software development efforts where collaboration is critical to project success. Objective: Given this, we have sought to study the influence of global software practitioners' personality profiles from a psycholinguistic perspective. Method: Artifacts from ten teams were selected from the IBM Rational Jazz repository and mined. We employed social network analysis (SNA) techniques to identify and group practitioners into two clusters based on the numbers of messages they communicated, Top Members and Others, and used standard statistical techniques to assess practitioners' engagement in task changes associated with work items. We then performed psycholinguistic analysis on practitioners' messages using linguistic dimensions of the LIWC tool that had been previously correlated with the Big Five personality profiles. Results: For our sample of 146 practitioners, we found that the Top Members demonstrated more openness to experience than the Other practitioners. Additionally, practitioners involved in usability-related tasks were found to be highly extroverted, and coders were most neurotic and conscientious. Conclusion: High levels of organizational and inter-personal skills may be useful for those operating in distributed settings, and personality diversity is likely to boost team performance.",Arxiv
169,"End-to-end Music-mixed Speech Recognition. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) in multimedia content is one of the promising applications, but speech data in this kind of content are frequently mixed with background music, which is harmful for the performance of ASR. In this study, we propose a method for improving ASR with background music based on time-domain source separation. We utilize Conv-TasNet as a separation network, which has achieved state-of-the-art performance for multi-speaker source separation, to extract the speech signal from a speech-music mixture in the waveform domain. We also propose joint fine-tuning of a pre-trained Conv-TasNet front-end with an attention-based ASR back-end using both separation and ASR objectives. We evaluated our method through ASR experiments using speech data mixed with background music from a wide variety of Japanese animations. We show that time-domain speech-music separation drastically improves ASR performance of the back-end model trained with mixture data, and the joint optimization yielded a further significant WER reduction. The time-domain separation method outperformed a frequency-domain separation method, which reuses the phase information of the input mixture signal, both in simple cascading and joint training settings. We also demonstrate that our method works robustly for music interference from classical, jazz and popular genres.",Arxiv
170,"Identifying Cover Songs Using Information-Theoretic Measures of Similarity. This paper investigates methods for quantifying similarity between audio signals, specifically for the task of of cover song detection. We consider an information-theoretic approach, where we compute pairwise measures of predictability between time series. We compare discrete-valued approaches operating on quantised audio features, to continuous-valued approaches. In the discrete case, we propose a method for computing the normalised compression distance, where we account for correlation between time series. In the continuous case, we propose to compute information-based measures of similarity as statistics of the prediction error between time series. We evaluate our methods on two cover song identification tasks using a data set comprised of 300 Jazz standards and using the Million Song Dataset. For both datasets, we observe that continuous-valued approaches outperform discrete-valued approaches. We consider approaches to estimating the normalised compression distance (NCD) based on string compression and prediction, where we observe that our proposed normalised compression distance with alignment (NCDA) improves average performance over NCD, for sequential compression algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate that continuous-valued distances may be combined to improve performance with respect to baseline approaches. Using a large-scale filter-and-refine approach, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for cover song identification using the Million Song Dataset.",Arxiv
171,"Headphones on the wire. We analyze a dataset providing the complete information on the effective plays of thousands of music listeners during several months. Our analysis confirms a number of properties previously highlighted by research based on interviews and questionnaires, but also uncover new statistical patterns, both at the individual and collective levels. In particular, we show that individuals follow common listening rhythms characterized by the same fluctuations, alternating heavy and light listening periods, and can be classified in four groups of similar sizes according to their temporal habits --- 'early birds', 'working hours listeners', 'evening listeners' and 'night owls'. We provide a detailed radioscopy of the listeners' interplay between repeated listening and discovery of new content. We show that different genres encourage different listening habits, from Classical or Jazz music with a more balanced listening among different songs, to Hip Hop and Dance with a more heterogeneous distribution of plays. Finally, we provide measures of how distant people are from each other in terms of common songs. In particular, we show that the number of songs $S$ a DJ should play to a random audience of size $N$ such that everyone hears at least one song he/she currently listens to, is of the form $S\sim N^α$ where the exponent depends on the music genre and is in the range $[0.5,0.8]$. More generally, our results show that the recent access to virtually infinite catalogs of songs does not promote exploration for novelty, but that most users favor repetition of the same songs.",Arxiv
172,"Interactive Music and Synchronous Reactive Programming. This paper presents Skini, a programming methodology and an execution environment for interactive structured music. With this system, the composer programs his scores in the HipHop.js synchronous reactive language. They are then executed, or played, in live concerts, in interaction with the audience. The system aims at helping composers to find a good balance between the determinism of the compositions and the nondeterminism of the interactions with the public. Each execution of a Skini score yields to a different but aesthetically consistent interpretation. This work raises many questions in the musical fields. How to combine composition and interaction? How to control the musical style when the audience influences what is to play next? What are the possible connections with generative music? These are important questions for the Skini system but they are out of the scope of this paper that focuses exclusively on the computer science aspects of the system. From that perspective, the main questions are how to program the scores and in which language? General purpose languages are inappropriate because their elementary constructs (i.e., variables, functions, loops, etc.) do not match the constructions needed to express music and musical constraints. We show that synchronous programming languages are a much better fit because they rely on temporal constructs that can be directly used to represent musical scores and because their malleability enables composers to experiment easily with artistic variations of their initial scores. The paper mostly focuses on scores programming. It exposes the process a composer should follow from his very first musical intuitions up to the generation of a musical artifact. The paper presents some excerpts of the programming of a classical music composition that it then precisely relates to an actual recording. Examples of techno music and jazz are also presented, with audio artifact, to demonstrate the versatility of the system. Finally, brief presentations of past live concerts are presented as an evidence of viability of the system.",Arxiv
173,"Communication and Personality Profiles of Global Software Developers. Context: Prior research has established that a small proportion of individuals dominate team communication during global software development. It is not known, however, how these members' contributions affect their teams' knowledge diffusion process, or whether their personality profiles are responsible for their dominant presence. Objective: We set out to address this gap through the study of repository artifacts. Method: Artifacts from ten teams were mined from the IBM Rational Jazz repository. We employed social network analysis (SNA) to group practitioners into two clusters, Top Members and Others, based on the numbers of messages they communicated and their engagement in task changes. SNA metrics (density, in-degree and closeness) were then used to study practitioners' importance in knowledge diffusion. Thereafter, we performed psycholinguistic analysis on practitioners' messages using linguistic dimensions that had been previously correlated with the Big Five personality profiles. Results: For our sample of 146 practitioners we found that Top Members occupied critical roles in knowledge diffusion, and demonstrated more openness to experience than the Others. Additionally, all personality profiles were represented during teamwork, although openness to experience, agreeableness and extroversion were particularly evident. However, no specific personality predicted members' involvement in knowledge diffusion. Conclusion: Task assignment that promotes highly connected team communication networks may mitigate tacit knowledge loss in global software teams. Additionally, while members expressing openness to experience are likely to be particularly driven to perform, this is not entirely responsible for a global team's success.",Arxiv
174,"Uncovering implementable dormant pruning decisions from three different stakeholder perspectives. Dormant pruning, or the removal of unproductive portions of a tree while a tree is not actively growing, is an important orchard task to help maintain yield, requiring years to build expertise. Because of long training periods and an increasing labor shortage in agricultural jobs, pruning could benefit from robotic automation. However, to program robots to prune branches, we first need to understand how pruning decisions are made, and what variables in the environment (e.g., branch size and thickness) we need to capture. Working directly with three pruning stakeholders -- horticulturists, growers, and pruners -- we find that each group of human experts approaches pruning decision-making differently. To capture this knowledge, we present three studies and two extracted pruning protocols from field work conducted in Prosser, Washington in January 2022 and 2023. We interviewed six stakeholders (two in each group) and observed pruning across three cultivars -- Bing Cherries, Envy Apples, and Jazz Apples -- and two tree architectures -- Upright Fruiting Offshoot and V-Trellis. Leveraging participant interviews and video data, this analysis uses grounded coding to extract pruning terminology, discover horticultural contexts that influence pruning decisions, and find implementable pruning heuristics for autonomous systems. The results include a validated terminology set, which we offer for use by both pruning stakeholders and roboticists, to communicate general pruning concepts and heuristics. The results also highlight seven pruning heuristics utilizing this terminology set that would be relevant for use by future autonomous robot pruning systems, and characterize three discovered horticultural contexts (i.e., environmental management, crop-load management, and replacement wood) across all three cultivars.",Arxiv

In recent years, machine learning, and in particular generative adversarial neural networks (GANs) and attention-based neural networks (transformers), have been successfully used to compose and generate music, both melodies and polyphonic pieces.

176,"From vertex detectors to inner trackers with CMOS pixel sensors. The use of CMOS Pixel Sensors (CPS) for high resolution and low material vertex detectors has been validated with the 2014 and 2015 physics runs of the STAR-PXL detector at RHIC/BNL. This opens the door to the use of CPS for inner tracking devices, with 10-100 times larger sensitive area, which require therefore a sensor design privileging power saving, response uniformity and robustness. The 350 nm CMOS technology used for the STAR-PXL sensors was considered as too poorly suited to upcoming applications like the upgraded ALICE Inner Tracking System (ITS), which requires sensors with one order of magnitude improvement on readout speed and improved radiation tolerance.

177,"Taste or Addiction?: Using Play Logs to Infer Song Selection Motivation. Online music services are increasing in popularity. They enable us to analyze people's music listening behavior based on play logs. Although it is known that people listen to music based on topic (e.g., rock or jazz), we assume that when a user is addicted to an artist, s/he chooses the artist's songs regardless of topic. Based on this assumption, in this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to analyze people's music listening behavior. Our main contributions are three-fold. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study modeling music listening behavior by taking into account the influence of addiction to artists. Second, by using real-world datasets of play logs, we showed the effectiveness of our proposed model. Third, we carried out qualitative experiments and showed that taking addiction into account enables us to analyze music listening behavior from a new viewpoint in terms of how people listen to music according to the time of day, how an artist's songs are listened to by people, etc. We also discuss the possibility of applying the analysis results to applications such as artist similarity computation and song recommendation.",Arxiv
178,"MusiCRS: Benchmarking Audio-Centric Conversational Recommendation. Conversational recommendation has advanced rapidly with large language models (LLMs), yet music remains a uniquely challenging domain where effective recommendations require reasoning over audio content beyond what text or metadata can capture.

MusiCRS contains 477 high-quality conversations spanning diverse genres (classical, hip-hop, electronic, metal, pop, indie, jazz) with 3,589 unique musical entities and audio grounding via YouTube links. MusiCRS enables evaluation across three input modality configurations: audio-only, query-only, and audio+query (multimodal), allowing systematic comparison of audio-LLMs, retrieval models, and traditional approaches. Our experiments reveal that current systems rely heavily on textual signals and struggle with nuanced audio reasoning. This exposes fundamental limitations in cross-modal knowledge integration where models excel at dialogue semantics but cannot effectively ground abstract musical concepts in actual audio content.
